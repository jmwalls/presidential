  "text": "9:06 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good to be back.  And Mitch and Chuck will understand it\u2019s good to be almost home, down the hall.  Anyway, thank you all.\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President \u2014 (applause) \u2014 no President has ever said those words from this podium.  No President has ever said those words, and it\u2019s about time.  (Applause.)\nFirst Lady \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I\u2019m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different \u2014 a reminder of the extraordinary times we\u2019re in.\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.\nI stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day\nof my administration \u2014 100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation \u2014 we all did \u2014 that was in crisis.\nThe worst pandemic in a century.  The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again \u2014 (applause) \u2014 turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.\nWe all know life can knock us down.  But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down.  Americans always get up.  Today, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view.  We\u2019re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.\nWe have shown each other and the world that there\u2019s no quit in America \u2014 none.\nOne hundred days ago, America\u2019s house was on fire.  We had to act.  And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor- \u2014 Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people \u2014 Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 we did act.\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan \u2014 one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.  We\u2019re already seeing the results.  (Applause.)   We\u2019re already seeing the results.\nAfter I promised we\u2019d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people\u2019s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days.  (Applause.)\nThanks to all the help of all of you, we\u2019re marshalling \u2014 with your help, everyone\u2019s help \u2014 we\u2019re marshalling every federal resource.  We\u2019ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000\npharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached.  We\u2019re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.\nToday, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site.  Everyone over the age of 16 \u2014 everyone\nis now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away.  (Applause.)  Go get vaccinated, America.  Go and get the vaccination.  They\u2019re available.  You\u2019re eligible now.\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected \u2014 fully protected.\nSenior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January \u2014 down 80 percent because of all of you.  And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse \u2014 I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d  She looked at me and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\u201d \u2014 was the phrase.  \u201cA dose of hope.\u201d\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease \u2014 wrote to me, said she\u2019s worried \u2014 that she was worrying about bringing the virus home.  She said she then got vaccinated at a \u2014 at a large site, in her car.  She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried \u2014 cried out of joy and cried out of relief.\nParents see the smiles on their kids\u2019 faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\nGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.\nIt means everything.  Those things mean everything.\nYou know, there\u2019s still \u2014 you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans \u2014 there\u2019s still more work to do to beat this virus.  We can\u2019t let our guard down.\nBut tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements \u2014 logistical achievements this country has ever seen.\nWhat else have we done in those first 100 days?\nWe kept our commitment \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households.  We\u2019ve already sent more than one \u2014 160 million checks out the door.  It\u2019s making the difference.  You all know it when you go home.  For many people, it\u2019s making all the difference in the world.\nA single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn\u2019t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.\nA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor \u2014 something she said she put off for months because she didn\u2019t have the money.\nOne of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up \u2014 cars lined up for miles.  And not \u2014 not people who just barely ever start those cars \u2014 nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I didn\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see that in America.  And all of this is through no fault of their own.  No fault of their own these people are in this position.\nThat\u2019s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.\nWe\u2019re also providing rental assistance \u2014 you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand \u2014 keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that \u2014 800,000 in that period.\nWe\u2019re making one of the largest one-time ever investments \u2014 ever \u2014 in improving healthcare for veterans.  Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.  And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  (Applause.)\nAnd in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days \u2014 more jobs in the first \u2014 (applause) \u2014 more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.\nThe International Monetary Fund \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year.  That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\nAmerica is moving \u2014 moving forward \u2014 but we can\u2019t stop now.  We\u2019re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.  We\u2019re at a great inflection point in history.\nWe have to do more than just build back better \u2014 I mean \u201cbuild back.\u201d  We have to build back better.  We have to compete more strenuously than we have.\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America \u2014 our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.\nThe transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.\nUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.\nScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon \u2014 now we\u2019re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make.  Time and again, they propel us into the future.\nThat\u2019s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan \u2014 a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.  This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.\nIt\u2019s clean water.  And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water \u2014 a clear and present danger to our children\u2019s health.\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation\u2019s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water.  (Applause.)\nAnd in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs.  It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn\u2019t have it.\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  \u2014 because I know it will get done.  (Applause.)\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid.  Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures \u2014 with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.  We can do that.  (Applause.)\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.\nTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic \u2014 two million.  And too often because they couldn\u2019t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.  If you think it\u2019s not important, check out in your own district.\nDemocrat or Republican \u2014 Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern \u2014 almost as much as their children \u2014 is taking care of an elderly loved one who can\u2019t be left alone.  Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\nFor too long, we\u2019ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: \u201cjobs.\u201d  Jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.)\nFor me, when I think \u201cclimate change,\u201d I think \u201cjobs.\u201d\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes.  Electrical workers \u2014 IBEW members \u2014 installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own \u2014 (applause) \u2014 so we can own the electric car market.  (Applause.)\nFarmers \u2014 farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  (Applause.)\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\u2019t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.  No reason.  None.  No reason.  (Applause.)\nSo, folks, there\u2019s no reason why American \u2014 American workers can\u2019t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.  I mean, there is no reason.  We have this capacity.  (Applause.)  We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs \u2014 jobs Americans can raise a family on \u2014 as my dad would then say, \u201cwith a little breathing room.\u201d\nAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American.  (Applause.)  Buy American.\nAnd I might note, parenthetically \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that does not \u2014 that does not violate any trade agreement.  It\u2019s been the law since the \u201930s: Buy American.\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs.  That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you \u2014 so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\u2019s so rapidly changing.  It\u2019s frightening.\nI want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that\u2019s what people are most worried about: \u201cCan I fit in?\u201d\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a \u2014 it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced.\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don\u2019t require an associate\u2019s degree.\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That\u2019s what it is.  (Applause.)\nAnd it recognizes something I\u2019ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\u2019t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act \u2014 the PRO Act \u2014 and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, while you\u2019re thinking about sending things to my desk \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 let\u2019s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)\nNo one \u2014 no one working 40 hours a week \u2014 no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we\u2019re doing this, let\u2019s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well \u2014 equal pay.  It\u2019s been much too long.  And if you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change \u2014 and some of you know more about this than I do \u2014 we\u2019ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That\u2019s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\nAnd we\u2019re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America \u2014 2 percent of our gross domestic product \u2014 in research and development.\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that\u2019s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you \u2014 and those of you on \u2014 who work on national security issues know \u2014 the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA \u2014 the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here \u2014 and that\u2019s been a long time ago \u2014 to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -\u2013 that\u2019s their only job.  And it\u2019s a semi-separate agency; it\u2019s under the Defense Department.  It\u2019s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\nThe National Institute of Health \u2014 the NIH \u2013- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.  (Applause.)\nAnd that would \u2014 here\u2019s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and cancer.\nI\u2019ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President \u2014 almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I\u2019ll never forget you standing and mentioning \u2014 saying you\u2019d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer.  I can think of no more worthy investment.  I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.  So, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it.  (Applause.)  It\u2019s within our power.  (Applause.)  It\u2019s within our power to do it.  (Applause.)\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we\u2019re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past.  Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan.  And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.\nSo, let\u2019s get to work.  I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions.  I\u2019d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different \u2014 they think are better.  I welcome those ideas.\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us.  I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option.  (Applause.)\nLook, we can\u2019t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi \u2014 traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.  When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion.  He\u2019s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world.  He and others \u2014 autocrats \u2014 think that democracy can\u2019t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.  That\u2019s why I\u2019ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\nFirst is access to a good education.  When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  It\u2019s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st \u2014 in the 20th century.\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up.  They are not waiting.  I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,\u201d I wonder whether we\u2019d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.  I doubt it.  Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\nThat\u2019s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years.  It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years.  It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school \u2014 not daycare \u2014 they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic.  (Applause.)  We can do that.  (Applause.)\nAnd we\u2019ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.  The reason is: They don\u2019t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy \u2014 all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\nJill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said \u2014 (applause).  She has long \u2014 (applause).  If I\u2019ve heard it once, I\u2019ve heard it a thousand times: \u201cJoe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.\u201d  She\u2019ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee \u2014 (applause).  And I\u2019m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won\u2019t have to spend a dime.\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave \u2014 family and medical leave.  We\u2019re one of the few industrial countries in the world \u2014 (applause).\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones \u2013- a parent, a spouse, or child.\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they\u2019re under [over]* six years of age \u2014 I mean, excuse me \u2014 under \u2014 over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\nWith two parents, two kids, that\u2019s $7,200 in the pockets that\u2019s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it.\nSo we did that in the rec- \u2014 in the \u2014 in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let\u2019s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that\u2019s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let\u2019s make that provision permanent so their premiums don\u2019t go back up.  (Applause.)\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I\u2019m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women\u2019s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly \u2014 how badly it\u2019s needed.  Let\u2019s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care \u2014 in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let\u2019s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.)\nWe know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America \u2014 nearly three times \u2014 for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can.\nLet\u2019s do what we\u2019ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this \u2014 in this body \u2014 in Congress.  Let\u2019s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, that won\u2019t just \u2014 that won\u2019t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It\u2019s within our power to do it; let\u2019s do it now.  (Applause.)\nWe\u2019ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let\u2019s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.)\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let\u2019s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share.\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year.  Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit.  A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.  It\u2019s not right.\nWe\u2019re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well.  (Applause.)\nWe\u2019re going to reward work, not just wealth.  We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans \u2014 those making over $400,000 or more \u2014 back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent.  That\u2019s where it was when George W. was President.\nWe\u2019re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck.   We\u2019re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action.  Three tenths of 1 percent.\nAnd the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.  It\u2019s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.\nI\u2019m not looking to punish anybody.  But I will not add a tax burden \u2014 an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country.  They\u2019re already paying enough.  I believe what I propose is fair \u2014 (applause) \u2014 fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\nWhen you hear someone say that they don\u2019t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: \u201cWhose taxes you want to raise instead?  Whose are you going to cut?\u201d\nLook, the big tax cut of 2017 \u2014 remember, it was supposed to pay for itself \u2014 that was how it was sold \u2014 and generate vast economic growth.  Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit.  It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\nInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs.  In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes.  It used to be in the \u2014 below a hundred.\nThe pandemic has only made things worse.  Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic \u2014 working- and middle-class Americans.  At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion \u2014 in the same exact period.  Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic.  And they\u2019re now worth more than $4 trillion.\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down \u2014 trickle-down economics has never worked and it\u2019s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.)\nYou know, there\u2019s a broad consensus of economists \u2014 left, right, center \u2014 and they agree what I\u2019m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth.  These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.\nI\u2019ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\nIn my conversations with world leaders \u2014 and I\u2019ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now \u2014 I\u2019ve made it known \u2014 I\u2019ve made it known that America is back.  And you know what they say?  The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, \u201cWe see America is back but for how long?  But for how long?\u201d\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\u2019re back, but that we\u2019re back to stay and that we aren\u2019t going to go it alone.  (Applause.)  We\u2019re going to do it by leading with our allies.  (Applause.)\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time \u2014 from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- \u2014 what we\u2019re experiencing now with pandemics.\nThere\u2019s no wall high enough to keep any virus out.  And our own vaccine supply \u2014 as it grows to meet our needs; and we\u2019re meeting them \u2014 will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and in consequence, influenced the world.  (Applause.)\nBut every American will have access before that occur- \u2014 every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 \u2014 from the vaccines we have.\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it\u2019s a global fight.  The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions.  The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent.  That\u2019s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord \u2014 because if we do everything perfectly, it\u2019s not going to ultimately matter.\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world \u2014 China, Russia, India, the European Union \u2014 and I said I\u2019d do it in my first 100 days.\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had \u2014 my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history.  And consensus \u2014 the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.\nIf you\u2019ve watched any of it \u2014 and you were all busy; I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t have much time \u2014 that\u2019s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren\u2019t doing their fair share.\nThe investments I\u2019ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class.  That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.\nIn my discussions \u2014 in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \u201cWe welcome the competition.  We\u2019re not looking for conflict.\u201d  But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\u2019s interests across the board.  America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state \u2014 to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.\nI also told President Xi that we\u2019ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe \u2014 not to start a conflict, but to prevent one.  (Applause.)\nI told him what I\u2019ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments \u2014 our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated.  An American President \u2014 President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for.  America is an idea \u2014 the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal.  It\u2019s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we\u2019re dealing with the American idea.\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we\u2019re not going to seek esca- \u2014 ecala- \u2014 exc- \u2014 excuse me \u2014 escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true.  And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia\u2019s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business.  They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.\nBut we can also cooperate when it\u2019s in our mutual interest.  We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we\u2019re working to do it on climate change.  But he understands we will respond.\nOn Iran and North Korea \u2014 nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world \u2014 we\u2019re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di- \u2014 through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.\nAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.  (Applause.)  We have \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.  I\u2019m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone.\nToday we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did.  We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.\nThe War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building.  We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists \u2014 the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 \u2014 and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it.  If you\u2019ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you\u2019ve kind of seen the gates of hell.  And we delivered justice to bin Laden.  We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.  And after 20 years of value \u2014 valor and sacrifice, it\u2019s time to bring those troops home.  (Applause.)\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland.  And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has \u2014 terrorism has metastasized.  The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan.  And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from.  Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.\nAnd we won\u2019t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism.  We\u2019re not going to ignore that either.\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation.  It was nearly a year ago, before her father\u2019s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\u2019s young daughter.  She\u2019s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye.  And she looked at me and she said, \u201cMy daddy changed the world.\u201d  Well, after the conviction of George Floyd\u2019s murderer, we can see how right she was if \u2014 if we have the courage to act as a Congress.\nWe\u2019ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans.  Now is our opportunity to make some real progress.  The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them.  I know they want \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd\u2019s name that passed the House already.\nI know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate.  We need to work together to find a consensus.  But let\u2019s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s death.  (Applause.)\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act \u2014 should act.  We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice \u2014 real justice.  And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity \u2014 good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house.  Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans \u2014 Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.  (Applause.)  You acted decisively.  (Applause.)  And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we\u2019ve seen over the past year \u2014 this past year and for too long.  I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans.  (Applause.)  To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.\nAnother thing: Let\u2019s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years.  (Applause.)  Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it.  It\u2019ll close the \u2014 the act that has to be authorized now will close the \u201cboyfriend\u201d loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.  The court order said, \u201cThis is an abuser.  You can\u2019t own a gun.\u201d  It\u2019s to close that loophole that existed.\nYou know, it\u2019s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America \u2014 50 a month.  Let\u2019s pass it and save some lives.  (Applause.)\nAnd I need not \u2014 I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.\nThe flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\nAnd in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America \u2014 250 shot dead.\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.  In the \u201990s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds.  We beat the NRA.  Mass shootings and gun violence declined.  Check out the report in over 10 years.  But in the early twe- \u2014 2000s, the law expired, and we\u2019ve seen daily bloodshed since.  I\u2019m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\u2019t see bloodshed.\nMore than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know \u2014 the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence \u2014 I laid out several of the Department of Justice a- \u2014 actions that are being taken to \u2014 impact on this epidemic.\nOne of them is banning so-called \u201cghost guns.\u201d  These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm.  The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can\u2019t be traced.  The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren\u2019t required to pass any background check.  Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that\u2019s lethal.  But no more.\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it\u2019s time for Congress to act as well.  (Applause.)\nLook, I don\u2019t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns.  We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  And don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done.  We did it before, and it worked.\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon.  What do you think \u2014 deer are wearing Kevlar vests?  (Laughter.)  They\u2019ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn\u2019t be able to buy a gun.\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners.  The country supports reform and is \u2014 and Congress should act.\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a red or blue issue.  And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.  You can\u2019t yell \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theater.  From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans.  Certain people could not own those weapons ever.\nWe\u2019re not changing the Constitution; we\u2019re being reasonable.  I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it\u2019s an American issue.\nAnd here\u2019s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America.  Let\u2019s end our exhausting war over immigration.  For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\u2019ve done nothing about it.  It\u2019s time to fix it.\nOn day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress.  If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security.  If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks \u2014 the vast majority are here overstaying visas.  Pass it.  We can actually \u2014 if you actually want to solve a problem, I\u2019ve sent a bill to take a close look at it.\nWe have to \u2014 also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to \u2014 to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.\nWhen I was President, my President \u2014 when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration.  And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.  The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.\nI\u2019m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this.  I have absolute confidence she\u2019ll get the job done.  (Applause.)\nNow, look, if you don\u2019t like my plan, let\u2019s at least pass what we all agree on.  Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers \u2014 the young people who have only known America as their home.  (Applause.)\nAnd permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster.  (Applause.)\nAs well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.  (Applause.)\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history.  The country supports immigration reform.  We should act.  Let\u2019s argue over it, let\u2019s debate it, but let\u2019s act.  (Applause.)\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote.  Most people \u2014 (applause).\nMore people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever.  It should be celebrated.  Instead, it\u2019s being attacked.\nCongress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away.  (Applause.)  The country supports it.  The Congress should act now.  (Applause.)\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.\nLives were put at risk \u2014 many of your lives.  Lives were lost.  Extraordinary courage was summoned.  The insurrection was an existential crisis \u2013- a test of whether our democracy could survive.  And it did.\nBut the struggle is far from over.  The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic \u2014 still vital today.\nCan our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\nCan our democracy deliver the most \u2014 to the most pressing needs of our people?\nCan our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?\nAmerica\u2019s adversaries \u2013- the autocrats of the world \u2013- are betting we can\u2019t.  And I promise you, they\u2019re betting we can\u2019t.  They believe we\u2019re too full of anger and division and rage.\nThey look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.  But they are wrong.  You know it; I know it.  But we have to prove them wrong.\nWe have to prove democracy still works \u2014 that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.\nIn our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people\u2019s faith in democracy to deliver.  We\u2019re vaccinating the nation.  We\u2019re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.  We\u2019re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice \u2014 that\u2019s the essence of America.  That\u2019s democracy in action.\nOur Constitution opens with the words \u2014 as trite as it sounds \u2014 \u201cWe the People\u201d.  Well, it\u2019s time to remember that \u201cWe the People\u201d are the government \u2014 you and I.  Not some force in a distant capital.  Not some powerful force that we have no control over.  It\u2019s us.  It\u2019s \u201cWe the People.\u201d\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \u201cIn America, we do our part.\u201d  We all do our part.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking: that we do our part, all of us.\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.  Autocrats will not win the future.  We will.  America will.  And the future belongs to America.\nAs I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America \u2014 not because I\u2019m President, because what\u2019s happening with the American people.\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \u201cWe the People\u201d did not flinch.\nAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together.  We united.\nWith light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.\nFolks, as I told every world leader I\u2019ve ever met with over the years, it\u2019s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\u2019t.  (Applause.)\nWe are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is not a single thing \u2014 nothing \u2014 nothing beyond our capacity.  We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together.  (Applause.)  So let\u2019s begin to get together.  (Applause.)\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you for your patience.  (Applause.)\n10:12 P.M. EDT"
