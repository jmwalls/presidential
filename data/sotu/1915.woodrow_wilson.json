  "text": "GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\nSince I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union \nthe war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to \ndisclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening and sinister \nscope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the \nglobe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the whole face of international \naffairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and reconstruction such \nas statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before.\nWe have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so. \nNot only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have \nbrought the conflict on; it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to \nbe avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that \nsome part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of peace \nalive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the breakdown throughout \nthe world of the industries by which its populations are fed and sustained. \nIt was manifestly the duty of the self-governed nations of this hemisphere to \nredress, if possible, the balance of economic loss and confusion in the other, \nif they could do nothing more. In the day of readjustment and recuperation we \nearnestly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service.\nIn this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate life \nand their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe but also by a clear \nperception of international duty, the states of America have become conscious \nof a new and more vital community of interest and moral partnership in affairs, \nmore clearly conscious of the many common sympathies and interests and duties \nwhich bid them stand together.\nThere was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the republics \nfighting their way to independence in Central and South America when the government \nof the United States looked upon itself as in some sort the guardian of the \nrepublics to the South of her as against any encroachments or efforts at political \ncontrol from the other side of the water; felt it its duty to play the part \neven without invitation from them; and I think that we can claim that the task \nwas undertaken with a true and disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the \nAmericas and the unmolested Selfgovernment of her independent peoples. But it \nwas always difficult to maintain such a role without offense to the pride of \nthe peoples whose freedom of action we sought to protect, and without provoking \nserious misconceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful man of affairs must \nwelcome the altered circumstances of the new day in whose light we now stand, \nwhen there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but, instead, a full \nand honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, \nin the interest of all America, north and south. Our concern for the independence \nand prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not altered. We \nretain unabated the spirit that has inspired us throughout the whole life of \nour government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. \nWe still mean always to make a common cause of national independence and of \npolitical liberty in America. But that purpose is now better understood so far \nas it concerns ourselves. It is known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known \nto have in it no thought of taking advantage of any government in this hemisphere \nor playing its political fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of \nAmerica stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genuine equality \nand unquestioned independence.\nWe have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the \ntest. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains \nto be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that \nwe will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake to impose upon \nher an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is often a fierce and \nintractable thing, to which no bounds can be set, and to which no bounds of \na few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the \ntrue fountains of principle and tradition must subscribe without reservation \nto the high doctrine of the Virginia Bill of Rights, which in the great days \nin which our government was set up was everywhere amongst us accepted as the \ncreed of free men. That doctrine is, \"That government is, or ought to be, instituted \nfor the common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or community\"; \nthat \"of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which \nis capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is \nmost effectually secured against the danger of maladministration; and that, \nwhen any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, \na majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible \nright to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most \nconducive to the public weal.\" We have unhesitatingly applied that heroic principle \nto the case of Mexico, and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled Republic, \nwhich had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside \nquarter in the radical but necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, \nbut we will not coerce her; and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient \nproof to all America that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control.\nThe moral is, that the states of America are not hostile rivals but cooperating \nfriends, and that their growing sense of community or interest, alike in matters \npolitical and in matters economic, is likely to give them a new significance \nas factors in international affairs and in the political history of the world. \nIt presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual \npartners, standing together because thinking together, quick with common sympathies \nand common ideals. Separated they are subject to all the cross currents of the \nconfused politics of a world of hostile rivalries; united in spirit and purpose \nthey cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny.\nThis is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is \nthe embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence \nand liberty and mutual service.\nA very notable body of men recently met in the City of Washington, at the \ninvitation and as the guests of this Government, whose deliberations are likely \nto be looked back to as marking a memorable turning point in the history of \nAmerica. They were representative spokesmen of the several independent states \nof this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial \nrelations of the republics of the two continents which nature and political \nfortune have so intimately linked together. I earnestly recommend to your perusal \nthe reports of their proceedings and of the actions of their committees. You \nwill get from them, I think, a fresh conception of the ease and intelligence \nand advantage with which Americans of both continents may draw together in practical \ncooperation and of what the material foundations of this hopeful partnership \nof interest must consist,-of how we should build them and of how necessary it \nis that we should hasten their building.\nThere is, I venture to point out, an especial significance just now attaching \nto this whole matter of drawing the Americans together in bonds of honorable \npartnership and mutual advantage because of the economic readjustments which \nthe world must inevitably witness within the next generation, when peace shall \nhave at last resumed its healthful tasks. In the performance of these tasks \nI believe the Americas to be destined to play their parts together. I am interested \nto fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within \nyour view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought I cannot \nfind the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at \nthe very font of my whole thought as I address you to-day. I mean national defense.\nNo one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are \nappointed to speak can fail to perceive that their passion is for peace, their \ngenius best displayed in the practice of the arts of peace. Great democracies \nare not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war. Their thought is of individual \nliberty and of the free labor that supports life and the uncensored thought \nthat quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning, or agreeable \nto our principles. But just because we demand unmolested development and the \nundisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and \nliberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves \nwill not practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines \nof national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. \nWe do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development \nto the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel \nit wherever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of \nindependence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans \nof liberty on this side the sea, and have deemed it as important that our neighbors \nshould be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be.- \nhave set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political \nfreemen.\nOut of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means \nof asserting the rights of a people against aggression. And we are as fiercely \njealous of coercive or dictatorial power within our own nation as of aggression \nfrom without. We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which are \nas necessary in times of peace as in times of war; and we shall always see to \nit that our military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and continuously \nneeded for the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. But we do believe \nin a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and \nof the governments which they have set up to serve them. In our constitutions \nthemselves we have commanded that \"the right of the people to keep and bear \narms shall not be infringed,\" and our confidence has been that our safety in \ntimes of danger would lie in the rising of the nation to take care of itself, \nas the farmers rose at Lexington.\nBut war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined \nmight. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, \nthey must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons \ncomes to render themselves immediately available and immediately effective. \nAnd the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with \nthe training they need to take care of themselves and of it. The military arm \nof their government, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly \nuse to serve them and make their independence secure,-and not their own independence \nmerely but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should \nthey also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in \nthe world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are qualified \nby principle and by chastened ambition to play.\nIt is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the Department of War for \nmore adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you, \nand which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be \nproperly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, \nand they seem to me for the present sufficient.\nThey contemplate an increase of the standing force of the regular army from \nits present strength of five thousand and twenty-three officers and one hundred \nand two thousand nine hundred and eightyfive enlisted men of all services to \na strength of seven thousand one hundred and thirty-six officers and one hundred \nand thirty-four thousand seven hundred and seven enlisted men, or 141,843, all \ntold, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of \ncoast artillery, fifteen companies of engineers, ten regiments of infantry, \nfour regiments of field artillery, and four aero squadrons, besides seven hundred \nand fifty officers required for a great variety of extra service, especially \nthe all important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently \nspeak, seven hundred and ninety-two noncommissioned officers for service in \ndrill, recruiting and the like, and the necessary quota of enlisted men for \nthe Quartermaster Corps, the Hospital Corps, the Ordnance Department, and other \nsimilar auxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the \narmy adequate for its present duties, duties which it has to perform not only \nupon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, \nbut also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus, and in \nPorto Rico.\nBy way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly \nand upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also contemplates supplementing \nthe army by a force of four hundred thousand disciplined citizens, raised in \nincrements of one hundred and thirty-three thousand a year throughout a period \nof three years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which \nthe serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve \nwith the colors for purposes of training for short periods throughout three \nyears, and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional \n\"furlough\" period of three years. This force of four hundred thousand men would \nbe provided with personal accoutrements as fast as enlisted and their equipment \nfor the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assembled \nfor training at stated intervals at convenient places in association with suitable \nunits of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily \nexceed two months in the year.\nIt would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the younger men of the country \nwhether they responded to such a call to service or not. It would depend upon \nthe patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether they made it possible \nfor the younger men in their employ to respond under favorable conditions or \nnot. I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young men \nor of those who give them employment,--those for whose benefit and protection \nthey would in fact enlist. I would look forward to the success of such an experiment \nwith entire confidence.\nAt least so much by way of preparation for defense seems to me to be absolutely \nimperative now. We cannot do less.\nThe programme which will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Navy is \nsimilarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which \nplans long matured shall be carried out; but it does make definite and explicit \na programme which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the minds of the \nCommittees on Naval Affairs and disclosed in the debates of the two Houses but \nnowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will \nbe to the advantage of the country for the Congress to adopt a comprehensive \nplan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and \nto press that plan to completion within the next five years. We have always \nlooked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense; we \nhave always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the \nseas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high indeed \namong the navies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely determine \nhow we shall complete what we have begun, and how soon.\nThe programme to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five \nyears of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty destroyers, \nfifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gunboats, one hospital \nship, two ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships, and one repair ship. It is proposed \nthat of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of \ntwo battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, \nfive fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats, and one hospital \nship; the second year, two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four \nfleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship; \nthe third year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five \ndestroyers, two fleet sub marines, and fifteen coast submarines; the fourth \nyear, two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, \ntwo fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition ship, and one \nfuel oil ship; and the fifth year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two \nscout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, \none gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair ship.\nThe Secretary of the Navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the \npersonnel of the navy of seven thousand five hundred sailors, twenty-five hundred \napprentice seamen, and fifteen hundred marines. This increase would be sufficient \nto care for the ships which are to be completed within the fiscal year 1917 \nand also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships \nwhich will be completed early in 1918. It is also necessary that the number \nof midshipmen at the Naval academy at Annapolis should be increased by at least \nthree hundred in order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added \nto; and authority is asked to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved \ngraduates of engineering colleges, and for service in the aviation corps a certain \nnumber of men taken from civil life.\nIf this full programme should be carried out we should have built or building \nin 1921, according to the estimates of survival and standards of classification \nfollowed by the General Board of the Department, an effective navy consisting \nof twenty-seven battleships of the first line, six battle cruisers, twenty-five \nbattleships of the second line, ten armored cruisers, thirteen scout cruisers, \nfive first class cruisers, three second class cruisers, ten third class cruisers, \none hundred and eight destroyers, eighteen fleet submarines, one hundred and \nfifty-seven coast submarines, six monitors, twenty gunboats, four supply ships, \nfifteen fuel ships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo vessels, eight \nvessels of special types, and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted \nto our needs and worthy of our traditions.\nBut armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be considered \nif we are to provide for the supreme matter of national self-sufficiency and \nsecurity in all its aspects. There are other great matters which will be thrust \nupon our attention whether we will or not. There is, for example, a very pressing \nquestion of trade and shipping involved in this great problem of national adequacy. \nIt is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development \nthat we should have a great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once \nused to make us rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our \nflag into every sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, \nwe have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference \nand by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so-called economic protection. \nIt is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our commercial independence \non the seas.\nFor it is a question of independence. If other nations go to war or seek to \nhamper each other's commerce, our merchants, it seems, are at their mercy, to \ndo with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them as they determine. \nWe have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the \nseas. Our independence is provincial, and is only on land and within our own \nborders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even the ships of other nations \nin rivalry of their own trade, and are without means to extend our commerce \neven where the doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situation is \nnot to be endured. It is of capital importance not only that the United States \nshould be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy the economic independence which \nonly an adequate merchant marine would give it, but also that the American hemisphere \nas a whole should enjoy a like independence and self-sufficiency, if it is not \nto be drawn into the tangle of European affairs. Without such independence the \nwhole question of our political unity and self-determination is very seriously \nclouded and complicated indeed.\nMoreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships \nof our own,--not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and carrying \nmuch more: creating friendships and rendering indispensable services to all \ninterests on this side the water. They must move constantly back and forth between \nthe Americas. They are the only shuttles that can weave the delicate fabric \nof sympathy, -comprehension, confidence, and mutual dependence in which we wish \nto clothe our policy of America for Americans.\nThe task of building up an adequate merchant marine for America private capital \nmust ultimately undertake and achieve, as it has undertaken and achieved every \nother like task amongst us in the past, with admirable enterprise, intelligence, \nand vigor; and it seems to me a manifest dictate of wisdom that we should promptly \nremove every legal obstacle that may stand in the way of this much to be desired \nrevival of our old independence and should facilitate in every possible way \nthe building, purchase, and American registration of ships. But capital cannot \naccomplish this great task of a sudden. It must embark upon it by degrees, as \nthe opportunities of trade develop. Something must be done at once; done to \nopen routes and develop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped; done \nto open the arteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned to run,-especially \nbetween the two American continents, where they are, singularly enough, yet \nto be created and quickened; and it is evident that only the government can \nundertake such beginnings and assume the initial financial risks. When the risk \nhas passed and private capital begins to find its way in sufficient abundance \ninto these new channels, the government may withdraw. But it cannot omit to \nbegin. It should take the first steps, and should take them at once. Our goods \nmust not lie piled up at our ports and stored upon side tracks in freight cars \nwhich are daily needed on the roads; must not be left without means of transport \nto any foreign quarter. We must not await the permission of foreign ship-owners \nand foreign governments to send them where we will.\nWith a view to meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and availing \nourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present unparalleled opportunity \nof linking the two Americas together in bonds of mutual interest and service, \nan opportunity which may never return again if we miss it now, proposals will \nbe made to the present Congress for the purchase or construction of ships to \nbe owned and directed by the government similar to those made to the last Congress, \nbut modified in some essential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you \nfor your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that \nhas elapsed since the former proposals were made has made the necessity for \nsuch action more and more manifestly imperative. That need was then foreseen; \nit is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting \nbut who can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested \nin the particulars of the programme as I am in taking immediate advantage of \nthe great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act in this emergency. \nIn this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, \nand out of it should come an early solution of this pressing problem.\nThere is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated \nwith the question of national safety and preparation for defense. That is our \npolicy towards the Philippines and the people of Porto Rico. Our treatment of \nthem and their attitude towards us are manifestly of the first consequence in \nthe development of our duties in the world and in getting a free hand to perform \nthose duties. We must be free from every unnecessary burden or embarrassment; \nand there is no better way to be clear of embarrassment than to fulfil our promises \nand promote the interests of those dependent on us to the utmost. Bills for \nthe alteration and reform of the government of the Philippines and for rendering \nfuller political justice to the people of Porto Rico were submitted to the sixty-third \nCongress. They will be submitted also to you. I need not particularize their \ndetails. You are most of you already familiar with them. But I do recommend \nthem to your early adoption with the sincere conviction that there are few measures \nyou could adopt which would more serviceably clear the way for the great policies \nby which we wish to make good, now and always, our right to lead in enterpriscs \nof peace and good will and economic and political freedom.\nThe plans for the armed forces of the nation which I have outlined, and for \nthe general policy of adequate preparation for mobilization and defense, involve \nof course very large additional expenditures of money,-expenditures which will \nconsiderably exceed the estimated revenues of the government. It is made my \nduty by law, whenever the estimates of expenditure exceed the estimates of revenue, \nto call the attention of the Congress to the fact and suggest any means of meeting \nthe deficiency that it may be wise or possible for me to suggest. I am ready \nto believe that it would be my duty to do so in any case; and I feel particularly \nbound to speak of the matter when it appears that the deficiency will arise \ndirectly out of the adoption by the Congress of measures which I myself urge \nit to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly of the present state of the \nTreasury and of the fiscal problems which the next year will probably disclose.\nOn the thirtieth of June last there was an available balance in the general \nfund of the Treasury Of $104,170,105.78. The total estimated receipts for the \nyear 1916, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by the \nlast Congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the thirty-first \nof December, 1915, and that the present duty of one cent per pound on sugar \nwill be discontinued after the first of May, 1916, will be $670,365,500. The \nbalance of June last and these estimated revenues come, therefore, to a grand \ntotal of $774,535,605-78. The total estimated disbursements for the present \nfiscal year, including twenty-five millions for the Panama Canal, twelve millions \nfor probable deficiency appropriations, and fifty thousand dollars for miscellaneous \ndebt redemptions, will be $753,891,000; and the balance in the general fund \nof the Treasury will be reduced to $20,644,605.78. The emergency revenue act, \nif continued beyond its present time limitation, would produce, during the half \nyear then remaining, about forty-one millions. The duty of one cent per pound \non sugar, if continued, would produce during the two months of the fiscal year \nremaining after the first of May, about fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting \ntogether to fifty-six millions, if added to the revenues of the second half \nof the fiscal year, would yield the Treasury at the end of the year an available \nbalance Of $76,644,605-78.\nThe additional revenues required to carry out the programme of military and \nnaval preparation of which I have spoken, would, as at present estimated, be \nfor the fiscal year, 1917, $93,800,000. Those figures, taken with the figures \nfor the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our financial \nproblem for the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes imposed by the emergency \nrevenue act and the present duty on sugar are to be discontinued, and that the \nbalance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $20,644,605.78, \nthat the disbursements for the Panama Canal will again be about twenty-five \nmillions, and that the additional expenditures for the army and navy are authorized \nby the Congress, the deficit in the general fund of the Treasury on the thirtieth \nof June, 1917, will be nearly two hundred and thirty-five millions. To this \nsum at least fifty millions should be added to represent a safe working balance \nfor the Treasury, and twelve millions to include the usual deficiency estimates \nin 1917; and these additions would make a total deficit of some two hundred \nand ninety-seven millions. If the present taxes should be continued throughout \nthis year and the next, however, there would be a balance in the Treasury of \nsome seventy-six and a half millions at the end of the present fiscal year, \nand a deficit at the end of the next year of only some fifty millions, or, reckoning \nin sixty-two millions for deficiency appropriations and a safe Treasury balance \nat the end of the year, a total deficit of some one hundred and twelve millions. \nThe obvious moral of the figures is that it is a plain counsel of prudence to \ncontinue all of the present taxes or their equivalents, and confine ourselves \nto the problem of providing one hundred and twelve millions of new revenue rather \nthan two hundred and ninety-seven millions.\nHow shall we obtain the new revenue? We are frequently reminded that there \nare many millions of bonds which the Treasury is authorized under existing law \nto sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the construction \nof the Panama Canal; and it is true that bonds to the amount of approximately \n$222,000,000 are now available for that purpose. Prior to 1913, $134,631,980 \nof these bonds had actually been sold to recoup the expenditures at the Isthmus; \nand now constitute a considerable item of the public debt. But I, for one, do \nnot believe that the people of this country approve of postponing the payment \nof their bills. Borrowing money is short-sighted finance. It can be justified \nonly when permanent things are to be accomplished which many generations will \ncertainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a single generation \nshould pay for. The objects we are now proposing to spend money for cannot be \nso classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to \nbe done in the interest of posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a \nclear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are \nnow, I hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the country \nare entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry, and to \nknow from the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation.\nTo what sources, then, shall we turn? This is so peculiarly a question which \nthe gentlemen of the House of Representatives are expected under the Constitution \nto propose an answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss \nit in very general terms. We should be following an almost universal example \nof modern governments if we were to draw the greater part or even the whole \nof the revenues we need from the income taxes. By somewhat lowering the present \nlimits of exemption and the figure at which the surtax shall begin to be imposed, \nand by increasing, step by step throughout the present graduation, the surtax \nitself, the income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient \nto balance the books of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without \nanywhere making the burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings \nare fully and accurately set out in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury \nwhich will be immediately laid before you.\nAnd there are many additional sources of revenue which can justly be resorted \nto without hampering the industries of the country or putting any too great \ncharge upon individual expenditure. A tax of one cent per gallon on gasoline \nand naphtha would yield, at the present estimated production, $io,ooo,ooo; a \ntax of fifty cents per horse power on automobiles and internal explosion engines, \n$15,000,000; a stamp tax on bank cheques, probably $18,ooo,ooo; a tax of twenty-five \ncents per ton on pig iron, $io,ooo,ooo; a tax of twenty-five cents per ton on \nfabricated iron and steel, probably $lo,ooo,ooo. In a country of great industries \nlike this it ought to be easy to distribute the burdens of taxation without \nmaking them anywhere bear too heavily or too exclusively upon any one set of \npersons or undertakings. What is clear is, that the industry of this generation \nshould pay the bills of this generation.\nI have spoken to you to-day, Gentlemen, upon a single theme, the thorough \npreparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of entire \nfreedom to play the impartial role in this hemisphere and in the world which \nwe all believe to have been providentially assigned to it. I have had in my \nmind no thought of any immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations \nwith other nations. We are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there \nis reason to hope that no question in controversy between this and other Governments \nwill lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences \nof attitude and policy have been land may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to \nsay that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been \nuttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush \nto admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization \nlaws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison \nof disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to \nbring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt, to destroy \nour industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes \nto strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue. \nTheir number is not great as compared with the whole number of those sturdy \nhosts by which our nation has been enriched in recent generations out of virile \nforeign stock; but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us \nand to have made it necessary that we should promptly make use of processes \nof law by which we may be purged of their corrupt distempers. America never \nwitnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn \ninto its own citizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied \nsome of the best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation \nthat in a high day of old staked its very life to free itself from every entanglement \nthat had darkened the fortunes of the older nations and set up a new standard \nhere,that men of such origins and such free choices of allegiance would ever \nturn in malign reaction against the Government and people who bad welcomed and \nnurtured them and seek to make this proud country once more a hotbed of European \npassion. A little while ago such a thing would have seemed incredible. Because \nit was incredible we made no preparation for it. We would have been almost ashamed \nto prepare for it, as if we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and \nneighbors! But the ugly and incredible thing has actually come about and we \nare without adequate federal laws to deal with it. I urge you to enact such \nlaws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you \nto do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such \ncreatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are \nnot many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should \nclose over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have \nentered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the Government, they have \nsought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order \nto serve interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things \nvery effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with.\nI wish that it could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken sentiments \nof allegiance to the governments under which they were born, had been guilty \nof disturbing the self-possession and misrepresenting the temper and principles \nof the country during these days of terrible war, when it would seem that every \nman who was truly an American would instinctively make it his duty and his pride \nto keep the scales of judgment even and prove himself a partisan of no nation \nbut his own. But it cannot. There are some men among us, and many resident abroad \nwho, though born and bred in the United States and calling themselves Americans, \nhave so forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate \nsympathy with one or the other side in the great European conflict above their \nregard for the peace and dignity of the United States. They also preach and \npractice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions of the mind and \nheart; but I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and expressing \nthe even deeper humiliation and scorn which every self-possessed and thoughtfully \npatriotic American must feel when lie thinks of them and of the discredit they \nare daily bringing upon us.\nWhile we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her security \nand her effective power we must not fall into the patent error of supposing \nthat her real strength comes from armaments and mere safeguards of written law. \nIt comes, of course, from her people, their energy, their success in their undertakings, \ntheir free opportunity to use the natural resources of our great home land and \nof the lands outside our continental borders which look to us for protection, \nfor encouragement, and for assistance in their development; from the organization \nand freedom and vitality of our economic life. The domestic questions which \nengaged the attention of the last Congress are more vital to the nation in this \nits time of test than at any other time. We cannot adequately make ready for \nany trial of our strength unless we wisely and promptly direct the force of \nour laws into these all-important fields of domestic action. A matter which \nit seems to me we should have very much at heart is the creation of the right \ninstrumentalities by which to mobilize our economic resources in any time of \nnational necessity. I take it for granted that I do not need your authority \nto call into systematic consultation with the directing officers of the army \nand navy men of recognized leadership and ability from among our citizens who \nare thoroughly familiar, for example, with the transportation facilities of \nthe country and therefore competent to advise how they may be coordinated when \nthe need arises, those who can suggest the best way in which to bring about \nprompt cooperation among the manufacturers of the country, should it be necessary, \nand those who could assist to bring the technical skill of the country to the \naid of the Government in the solution of particular problems of defense. I only \nhope that if I should find it feasible to constitute such an advisory body the \nCongress would be willing to vote the small sum of money that would be needed \nto defray the expenses that would probably be necessary to give it the clerical \nand administrative Machinery with which to do serviceable work.\nWhat is more important is, that the industries and resources of the country \nshould be available and ready for mobilization. It is the more imperatively \nnecessary, therefore, that we should promptly devise means for doing what we \nhave not yet done: that we should give intelligent federal aid and stimulation \nto industrial and vocational education, as we have long done in the large field \nof our agricultural industry; that, at the same time that we safeguard and conserve \nthe natural resources of the country we should put them at the disposal of those \nwho will use them promptly and intelligently, as was sought to be done in the \nadmirable bills submitted to the last Congress from its committees on the public \nlands, bills which I earnestly recommend in principle to your consideration; \nthat we should put into early operation some provision for rural credits which \nwill add to the extensive borrowing facilities already afforded the farmer by \nthe Reserve Bank Act, adequate instrumentalities by which long credits may be \nobtained on land mortgages; and that we should study more carefully than they \nhave hitherto been studied the right adaptation of our economic arrangements \nto changing conditions.\nMany conditions about which we I-lave repeatedly legislated are being altered \nfrom decade to decade, it is evident, under our very eyes, and are likely to \nchange even more rapidly and more radically in the days immediately ahead of \nus, when peace has returned to the world and the nations of Europe once more \ntake up their tasks of commerce and industry with the energy of those who must \nbestir themselves to build anew. just what these changes will be no one can \ncertainly foresee or confidently predict. There are no calculable, because no \nstable, elements in the problem. The most we can do is to make certain that \nwe have the necessary instrumentalities of information constantly at our service \nso that we may be sure that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we \ncome to act, if it should be necessary to act at all. We must first certainly \nknow what it is that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to. I may ask the privilege \nof addressing you more at length on this important matter a little later in \nyour session.\nIn the meantime may I make this suggestion? The transportation problem is \nan exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from time \nto time of late been reason to fear that our railroads would not much longer \nbe able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and coordinated \nI suggest that it would be wise to provide for a commission of inquiry to ascertain \nby a thorough canvass of the whole question whether our laws as at present framed \nand administered are as serviceable as they might be' in the solution of the \nproblem. It is obviously a problem that lies at the very foundation of our efficiency \nas a people. Such an inquiry ought to draw out every circumstance and opinion \nworth considering and we need to know all sides of the matter if we mean to \ndo anything in the field of federal legislation.\nNo one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regulation of \nthe railways of the country by federal commission has had admirable results \nand has fully justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the policy \nof regulation was originally proposed. The question is not what should we undo? \nIt is, whether thei-e is anything else we can do that would supply us with effective \nmeans, in the very process of regulation, for bettering the conditions under \nwhich the railroads are operated and for making them more useful servants of \nthe country as a whole. It seems to me that it might be the part of wisdom, \ntherefore, before further legislation in this field is attempted, to look at \nthe whole problem of coordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh \nassessment of circumstance and opinion, as a guide to dealing with the several \nparts of it.\nFor what we are seeking now, what in my mind is the single thought of this \nmessage, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We should \nserve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men \nfor self-government, industry, justice, liberty and peace. We should see to \nit that it lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient \nto play its part with energy, safety, and assured success. In this we are no \npartisans but heralds and prophets of a new age."
