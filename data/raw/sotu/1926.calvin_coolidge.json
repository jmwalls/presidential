  "text": "Members of the Congress:\nIn reporting to the Congress the state of the Union, I find it impossible to \ncharacterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity. In some quarters \nour diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolved problems, but nowhere \nare we met with armed conflict. If some occupations and areas are not flourishing, \nin none does there remain any acute chronic depression. What the country requires \nis not so much new policies as a steady continuation of those which are already \nbeing crowned with such abundant success. It can not be too often repeated that \nin common with all the world we are engaged in liquidating the war.\nIn the present short session no great amount of new legislation is possible, \nbut in order to comprehend what is most desirable some survey of our general \nsituation is necessary. A large amount of time is consumed in the passage of \nappropriation bills. If each Congress in its opening session would make appropriations \nto continue for two years, very much time would be saved which could either \nbe devoted to a consideration of the general needs of the country or would result \nin decreasing the work of legislation.\nECONOMY\nOur present state of prosperity has been greatly promoted by three important \ncauses, one of which is economy, resulting in reduction and reform in national \ntaxation. Another is the elimination of many kinds of waste. The third is a \ngeneral raising of the standards of efficiency. This combination has brought \nthe perfectly astonishing result of a reduction in the index price of commodities \nand an increase in the index rate of wages. We have secured a lowering of the \ncost to produce and a raising of the ability to consume. Prosperity resulting \nfrom these causes rests on the securest of all foundations. It gathers strength \nfrom its own progress.\nIn promoting this progress the chief part which the National Government \nplays lies in the field of economy. Whatever doubts may have been entertained \nas to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial results which would accrue \nfrom it to all the people of the Nation, its wisdom must now be considered thoroughly \ndemonstrated. It may not have appeared to be a novel or perhaps brilliant conception, \nbut it has turned out to be preeminently sound. It has not failed to work. It has surely brought results. It does not have to be excused as a temporary expedient adopted as the lesser evil to remedy some abuse, it is not. a palliative seeking to treat symptoms, but a major operation for the, eradication at the source of a large number of social diseases.\nNothing is easier than the expenditure of public money. It does not appear \nto belong to anybody. The temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody. \nBut the results of extravagance are ruinous. The property of the country, like \nthe freedom of the country, belongs to the people of the country. They have \nnot empowered their Government to take a dollar of it except for a necessary \npublic purpose. But if the Constitution conferred such right, sound economics \nwould forbid it. Nothing is more, destructive of the progress of the Nation \nthan government extravagance. It means an increase in the burden of taxation, \ndissipation of the returns from enterprise, a decrease in the real value of \nwages, with ultimate stagnation and decay. The whole theory of our institutions \nis based on the liberty and independence of the individual. He is dependent \non himself for support and therefore entitled to the rewards of his own industry. \nHe is not to be deprived of what he earns that others may be benefited by what \nthey do not earn. What lie saves through his private effort is not to be wasted \nby Government extravagance.\nOur national activities have become so vast that it is necessary to scrutinize \neach item of public expenditure if we are to apply the principle of economy. \nAt the last session we made an immediate increase in the annual budget of more \nthan $100,000,000 in benefits conferred on the veterans of three wars, public \nbuildings, and river and harbor improvement. Many projects are being broached \nrequiring further large outlays. I am convinced that it would be greatly for \nthe welfare of the country if we avoid at the present session all commitments \nexcept those of the most pressing nature. From a reduction of the debt and taxes \nwill accrue a wider benefit to all the people of this country than from embarking \non any new enterprise. When our war debt is decreased we shall have resources \nfor expansion. Until that is accomplished we should confine ourselves to expenditures \nof the most urgent necessity.\nThe Department of Commerce has performed a most important function in making \nplans and securing support of all kinds of national enterprise for the elimination \nof waste. Efficiency has been greatly promoted through good management and the \nconstantly increasing cooperation of the wage earners throughout the whole realm \nof private business. It is my opinion that this whole development has been predicated \non the foundation of a protective tariff.\nTAX REDUCTION\nAs a result of economy of administration by the Executive and of appropriation \nby the Congress, the end of this fiscal year will leave a surplus in the Treasury \nestimated at $383,000,000. Unless otherwise ordered, such surplus is used for \nthe retirement of the war debt. A bond which can be retired today for 100 cents \nwill cost the, people 104 1/4 cents to retire a year from now. While I favor \na speedy reduction of the debt as already required by law and in accordance \nwith the promises made to the holders of our Liberty bonds when they were issued, \nthere is no reason why a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be applied \nto a reduction of taxation. It can not be repeated too often that the enormous \nrevenues of this Nation could not be collected without becoming a charge on \nall the people whether or not they directly pay taxes. Everyone who is paying \nor the bare necessities of fool and shelter and clothing, without considering \nthe better things of life, is indirectly paying a national tax. The nearly 20,000,000 \nowners of securities, the additional scores of millions of holders of insurance \npolicies and depositors in savings banks, are all paying a national tax. Millions \nof individuals and corporations are making a direct contribution to the National \nTreasury which runs from 11/2 to 25 per cent of their income, besides a number \nof special requirements, like automobile and admission taxes. Whenever the state \nof the Treasury will permit, I believe in a reduction of taxation. I think the \ntaxpayers are entitled to it. But I am not advocating tax reduction merely for \nthe benefit of the taxpayer; I am advocating it for the benefit of the country.\nIf it appeared feasible, I should welcome permanent \ntax reduction at this time. The estimated surplus, however, for June 30, 1928, \nis not much larger than is required in a going business of nearly $4,000,000,000. \nWe have had but a few months' experience under the present revenue act and shall \nneed to know what is developed by the returns of income produced under it, which \nare not required t o be made until about the time this session terminates, and \nwhat the economic probabilities of the country are in the latter part of 1927, \nbefore we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax reduction. \nMoreover the present surplus results from many nonrecurrent items. Meantime, \nit is possible to grant some real relief by a simple measure making reductions \nin the payments which accrue on the 15th of March and June, 1927. 1 am very \nstrongly of the conviction that this is so much a purely business matter that \nit ought not to be dealt with in a partisan spirit. The Congress has already \nset the notable example of treating tax problems without much reference to party, \nwhich might well be continued. What I desire to advocate most earnestly is relief \nfor the country from unnecessary tax burdens. We can not secure that if we stop \nto engage in a partisan controversy. As I do not think any change in the special \ntaxes, or tiny permanent reduction is practical, I therefore urge both parties \nof the House Ways and Means Committee to agree on a bill granting the temporary \nrelief which I have indicated. Such a reduction would directly affect millions \nof taxpayers, release large sums for investment in new enterprise, stimulating \nindustrial production and agricultural consumption, and indirectly benefiting \nevery family in the whole country. These are my convictions stated with full \nknowledge that it is for the Congress to decide whether they judge it best to \nmake such a reduction or leave the surplus for the present year to be applied \nto retirement of the war debt. That also is eventually tax reduction.\nPROTECTIVE TARIFF\nIt is estimated that customs receipts for the present fiscal year will \nexceed $615,000,000, the largest which were ever secured from that source. The \nvalue of our imports for the last fiscal year was $4,466,000,000, an increase \nof more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law went into effect. Of these \nimports about 65 per cent, or, roughly, $2,900,000,000, came in free of duty, \nwhich means that the United States affords a duty-free market to other countries \nalmost equal in value to the total imports of Germany and greatly exceeding \nthe total imports of France. We have admitted a greater volume of free imports \nthan any other country except England.\nWe are, therefore, levying duties on about $1,550,000,000 of imports. Nearly \nhalf of this, or $700,000,000, is subject to duties for the protection of agriculture \nand have their origin in countries other than Europe. They substantially increased \nthe prices received by our farmers for their produce. About $300,000.000 more \nis represented by luxuries such as costly rugs, furs, precious stones, etc. \nThis leaves only about $550,000,000 of our imports under a schedule of duties \nwhich is in general under consideration when there is discussion of lowering \nthe tariff. While the duties on this small portion, representing only about \n12 per cent of our imports, undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair \ndegree of prosperity or marked depression to many of our industries and the \ndifference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of \nour wage earners, it is impossible to conceive how other countries or our own \nimporters could be greatly benefited if these duties are reduced. Those who \nare starting an agitation for a reduction of tariff duties, partly at least \nfor the benefit of those to whom money has been lent abroad, ought to know that \nthere does not seem to be a very large field within the area of our imports \nin which probable reductions would be advantageous to foreign goods. Those who \nwish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely to secure that result \nby continuing the present enormous purchasing power which comes from our prosperity \nthat hall?' increased our imports over 71 per cent in four years than from any \nadvantages that are likely to accrue from a general tariff reduction.\nAGRICULTURE\nThe important place which agriculture holds in the economic and social life \nof the Nation can not be overestimated. The National Government is justified \nin putting forth every effort to make the open country a desirable place to \nlive. No condition meets this requirement which fails to supply a fair return \non labor expended and capital invested. While some localities and some particular \ncrops furnish exceptions, in general agriculture is continuing to make progress \nin recovering from the depression of 1921 and 1922. Animal products and food \nproducts are in a more encouraging position, while cotton, due to the high prices \nof past years supplemented by ideal weather conditions, has been stimulated \nto a point of temporary over production. Acting on the request of the \ncotton growing interests, appointed a committee to assist in carrying out their \nplans. As it result of this cooperation sufficient funds have been pledged to \nfinance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bales of cotton. Whether those \nwho own the cotton are willing to put a part of their stock into this plan depends \non themselves. The Federal Government has cooperated in providing ample facilities. \nNo method of meeting the situation would be adequate which does not contemplate \na reduction of about one-third in the acreage for the coming year. The responsibility \nfor making the plan effective lies with those who own and finance cotton and \ncotton lands.\nThe Department of Agriculture estimates the net income of agriculture for the \nyear 1920-21 at only $375,000,000; for 1924-25, $2,656,000,000; for 1925-26, \n$2,757,000,000. This increase has been brought about in part by the method already \nreferred to, of Federal tax reduction, the elimination of waste, and increased \nefficiency in industry. The wide gap that existed a few years ago between the \nindex price of agricultural products and the index price of other products has \nbeen gradually closing up, though the recent depression in cotton has somewhat \nenlarged it. Agriculture had on the whole been going higher while industry had \nbeen growing lower. Industrial and commercial activities, being carried on for \nthe most part by corporations, are taxed at a much higher rate than farming, \nwhich is carried on by individuals. This will inevitably make industrial commodity \ncosts high while war taxation lasts. It is because of this circumstance that \nnational tax reduction has a very large indirect benefit upon the farmer, though \nit can not relieve him from the very great burden of the local taxes which he \npays directly. We have practically relieved the farmer of any Federal income \ntax.\nThere is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agricultural \nindustry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war and that \nfurther improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural products is most \ndesirable. There is belief also that the Federal Government can further contribute \nto these ends beyond the many helpful measures taken during the last five years \nthrough the different acts of Congress for advancing the interests of the farmers.\nThe packers and stockyards act,\nEstablishing of the intermediate credit banks for agricultural purposes,\nThe Purnell Act for agricultural research,\nThe Capper-Volstead Cooperative Marketing Act,\nThe cooperative marketing act of 1926,\nAmendments to the warehousing act,\nThe enlargement of the activities of the Department of Agriculture,\nEnlargement of the scope of loans by the Farm Loan Board,\nThe tariff on agricultural products,\nThe large Federal expenditure in improvement of waterways and highways,\nThe reduction of Federal taxes, in all comprise a great series of governmental \nactions in the advancement of the special interest of agriculture.\nIn determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to me \nthere are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoiding them \nshould be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself.\nActing upon my recommendation, the Congress has ordered the interstate Commerce \nCommission to investigate the freight-rate structure, directing that such changes \nshall be made in freight rates as will promote freedom of movement of agricultural \nproducts. Railroad consolidation which I am advocating would also result in \na situation where rates could be made more advantageous for farm produce, as \nhas recently been done in the revision of rates on fertilizers in the South. \nAdditional benefit will accrue from the development of our inland waterways. \nThe Mississippi River system carries a commerce of over 50,000,000 tons at a \nsaving of nearly $18,000,000 annually. The Inland Waterways Corporation operates \nboats on 2,500 miles of navigable streams and through its relation with 165 \nrailroads carries freight into and out of 45 States of the Union. During the \npast six months it has handled over 1,000,000 bushels of grain monthly and by \nits lower freight rates has raised the price of such grain to the farmer probably \n21/2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. The highway system on which the Federal Government \nexpends about $85,000,000 a year is of vital importance to the rural regions.\nThe advantages to be derived from a more comprehensive and less expensive system. \nof transportation for agriculture ought to be supplemented by provision for \nan adequate supply of fertilizer at a lower cost than it is at. present obtainable. \nThis advantage we are attempting to secure by the proposed development at Muscle \nShoals, and there are promising experiments being made in synthetic chemistry \nfor the production of nitrates.\n\nThe development of sound and strong cooperative associations is of fundamental \nimportance to our agriculture. It is encouraging to note, therefore, that a \nvigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement is continuing. Cooperative \nassociations reporting to the Department of Agriculture at the end of 1925 had \non their membership rolls a total of 2,700,000 producers. Their total business \nin 1925 amounted to approximately $2,400,000,000, compared with $635,800,000 \nin 1915. Legislative action to assist cooperative associations and supplement \ntheir efforts was passed at the last session of Congress. Important credit measures \nwere also provided by Congress in 1923 which have been of inestimable value \nto the cooperative associations. Although the Federal credit agencies have served \nagriculture well, I think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service \nof these institutions.\nAttention is again directed to the surplus problem of agriculture by the present \ncotton situation. Surpluses often affect prices of various farm commodities \nin a disastrous manner, and the problem urgently demand?, a solution. Discussions \nboth in and out of Congress during the past few years have given us a better \nunderstanding of the subject, and it is my hope that out of the various proposals \nmade the basis will be found for a sound and effective solution upon which agreement \ncan be reached. In my opinion cooperative marketing associations will be important \naids to the ultimate solution of the problem. It may well be, however, that \nadditional measures will be needed to supplement their efforts. I believe all \nwill agree that such measures should not conflict with the best interests of \nthe cooperatives, but rather assist and strengthen them. In working out this \nproblem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting the Government \ninto the business of production or marketing or attempting to enact legislation \nfor the purpose of price fixing. The farmer does not favor any attempted remedies \nthat partake of these elements. He has a sincere and candid desire for assistance. \nIf matched by an equally sincere and candid consideration of the different remedies \nproposed ' a sound measure of relief ought to result. It is unfortunate that \nno general agreement has been reached by the various agricultural interests \nupon any of the proposed remedies. Out of the discussion of various proposals \nwhich can be had before the Committees of Agriculture some measure ought to \nbe perfected which would be generally satisfactory.\nDue to the emergency arising from a heavy tropical storm in southern Florida, \nI authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use certain funds in anticipation \nof legislation to enable the farmers in that region to plant their crops. \nThe department will present a bill ratifying the loans which were made for this \npurpose.\nFederal legislation has been adopted authorizing the cooperation of the Government \nwith States and private owners in the protection of forest lands from fire.\nThis preventive measure is of such great importance that I have recommended \nfor it an increased appropriation.\nAnother preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance is the \neradication of tuberculosis in cattle. Active work is now in progress in one-fourth \nof the counties of the United States to secure this result. Over 12,000,000 \ncattle have been under treatment, and the average degree of infection has fallen \nfrom 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent. he Federal Government is making substantial \nexpenditures for this purpose.\nSerious damage is threatened to the corn crop by the European corn borer. Since \n1917 it has spread from eastern New England westward into Indiana and now covers \nabout 100,000 square miles. It is one of the most formidable pests because it \nspreads rapidly and is exceedingly difficult of control. It has assumed a menace \nthat is of national magnitude and warrants the Federal Government in extending \nits cooperation to the State and local agencies which are attempting to prevent \nits further spread and secure its eradication.\nThe whole question of agriculture needs most careful consideration. In the \npast few years the Government has given this subject more attention than any \nother and has held more consultations in relation to it than on any other subject. \nWhile the Government is not to be blamed for failure to perform the impossible, \nthe agricultural regions are entitled to know that they have its constant solicitude \nand sympathy. Many of the farmers are burdened with debts and taxes which they \nare unable to carry. We are expending in this country many millions of dollars \neach year to increase farm production. We ought now to put more emphasis on \nthe question of farm marketing. If a sound solution of a permanent nature can \nbe found for this problem, the Congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it.\nDEVELOPMENT OF WATER RESOURCES\nIn previous messages I have referred to the national importance of the proper \ndevelopment of our water resources. The great projects of extension of the Mississippi \nsystem, the protection an development of the lower Colorado River, are before \nCongress, and I have previously commented upon them. I favor the necessary legislation \nto expedite these projects. Engineering studies are being made for connecting \nthe Great Lakes with the North Atlantic either through an all-American canal \nor by way of the St. Lawrence River. These reports will undoubtedly be before \nthe Congress during its present session. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the \ngreat importance of such a waterway not only to our mid-continental basin but \nto the commerce and development of practically the whole Nation. Our river and \nharbor improvement should be continued in accordance with the present policy. \nExpenditure of this character is compatible with economy; it is in the nature \nof capital investment. Work should proceed on the basic trunk lines if this \nwork is to be a success. If the country will be content to be moderate and patient \nand permit improvements to be made where they will do the greatest general good, \nrather than insisting on expenditures at this time on secondary projects, our \ninternal Waterways can be made a success. If proposes legislation results in \na gross manifestation of local jealousies and selfishness, this program can \nnot be carried out. Ultimately we can take care of extensions, but our first \neffort should be confined to the main arteries.\nOur inland commerce has been put to great inconvenience and expense by reason \nof the lowering of the water level of the Great Lakes. This is an international \nproblem on which competent engineers are making reports. Out of their study \nit is expected that a feasible method will be developed for raising the level \nto provide relief for our commerce and supply water for drainage. Whenever a \npractical plan is presented it ought to be speedily adopted.\nRECLAMATION\nIt is increasingly evident that the Federal Government must in the future take \na leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with incidental power \nfor the development of the irrigable lands of the and region. The unused waters \nof the West are found mainly in large rivers. Works to store and distribute \nthese have such magnitude and cost that they are not attractive to private enterprise. \nWater is the irreplaceable natural resource. Its precipitation can not be increased. \nIts storage on the higher reaches of streams, to meet growing needs, to be used \nrepeatedly as it flows toward the seas, is a practical and prudent business \npolicy.\nThe United States promises to follow the course of older irrigation countries, \nwhere recent important irrigation developments have been carried out as national \nundertakings. It is gratifying, therefore, that conditions on Federal reclamation \nprojects have become satisfactory. The gross value of crop,, grown with water \nfrom project works increased from $110,000,000 in 1924 to $131,000,000 in 1925. \nThe adjustments made last year by Congress relieved irrigators from paying construction \ncosts on unprofitable land, and by so doing inspired new hope and confidence \nin ability to meet the payments required. Construction payments by water users \nlast year were the largest in the history of the bureau.\nThe anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorbed for a number of years \nin the completion of old projects and the construction of projects inaugurated \nin the past three years. We should, however, continue to investigate and study \nthe possibilities of a carefully planned development of promising projects, \nlogically of governmental concern because of their physical magnitude, immense \ncost, and the interstate and international problems involved. Only in this way \nmay we be fully prepared to meet intelligently the needs of our fast-growing \npopulation in the years to come.\nTRANSPORTATION\nIt would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contributes \nmore to the necessities and conveniences of life than transportation. Without \nit our present agricultural production and practically all of our commerce would \n?be completely prostrated. One of the large contributing causes to the present \nhighly satisfactory state of our economic condition is the prompt and dependable \nservice, surpassing all our previous records, rendered by the railroads. This \npower has been fostered by the spirit of cooperation between Federal and State \nregulatory commissions. To render this service more efficient and effective \nand to promote a more scientific regulation, the process of valuing railroad \nproperties should be simplified and the primary valuations should be completed \nas rapidly as possible. The problem of rate reduction would be much simplified \nby a process of railroad consolidations. This principle has already been adopted \nas Federal law. Experience has shown that a more effective method must be provided. \nStudies have already been made and legislation introduced seeking to promote \nthis end. It would be of great advantage if it could be taken up at once and \nspeedily enacted. The railroad systems of the country and the convenience of \nall the people are waiting on this important decision.\nMERCHANT MARINE\nIt is axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the full \nbenefit of its own advantages without a merchant marine. We have been proceeding \nunder the act of Congress that contemplates the establishment of trade routes \nto be ultimately transferred to private ownership and operation. Due to temporary \nconditions abroad and at home we have a large demand just now for certain types \nof freight vessels. Some suggestion has been made for new construction. I do \nnot feel that we are yet warranted in entering, that field. Such ships as we \nmight build could not be sold after they are launched for anywhere near what \nthey would cost. We have expended over $250,000,000 out of the public Treasury \nin recent years to make up the losses of operation, not counting the depreciation \nor any cost whatever of our capital investment. The great need of our merchant \nmarine is not for more ships but for more freight.\nOur merchants are altogether too indifferent about using American ships for \nthe transportation of goods which they send abroad or bring home. Some of our \nvessels necessarily need repairs, which should be made. I do not believe that \nthe operation of our fleet is as economical and efficient as it could be made \nif placed under a single responsible head, leaving the Shipping Board free to \ndeal with general matters of policy and regulation.\nRADIO LEGISLATION\nThe Department of Commerce has for some years urgently presented the necessity \nfor further legislation in order to protect radio listeners from interference \nbetween broadcasting stations and to carry out other regulatory functions. Both \nbranches of Congress at the last session passed enactments intended to effect \nsuch regulation, but the two bills yet remain to be brought into agreement and \nfinal passage.\nDue to decisions of the courts, the authority of the department under the law \nof 1912 has broken down; many more stations have been operating than can be \naccommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available; further stations \nare in course of construction; many stations have departed from the scheme of \nallocation set down by the department, and the whole service of this most important \npublic function has drifted into such chaos as seems likely, if not remedied, \nto destroy its great value. I most urgently recommend that this legislation \nshould be speedily enacted.\nI do not believe it is desirable to set tip further independent agencies \nin the Government. Rather I believe it advisable to entrust the important functions \nof deciding who shall exercise the privilege of radio transmission and under \nwhat conditions, the assigning of wave lengths and determination of power, to \na board to be assembled whenever action on such questions becomes necessary. \nThere should be right of appeal to the courts from the decisions of such board. \nThe administration of the decisions of the board and the other features of regulation \nand promotion of radio in the public interest, together with scientific research, \nshould remain in the Department of Commerce. Such an arrangement makes for more \nexpert, more efficient, and more economical administration that an independent \nagency or board, whose duties, after initial stages, require but little attention, \nin which administrative functions are confused with semijudicial functions and \nfrom which of necessity there must be greatly increased personnel and expenditure.\nTHE WAGE EARNER\nThe great body of our people are made up of wage earners. Several hundred \nthousands of them are on the pay rolls of the United States Government. Their \ncondition very largely is fixed by legislation. We have recently provided \nincreases in compensation under a method of reclassification and given them \nthe advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for their declining \nyears. Most of them are under the merit system, which is a guaranty of \ntheir intelligence, and the efficiency of their service is a demonstration of \ntheir loyalty. The Federal Government should continue to set a good example \nfor all other employers.\nIn the industries the condition of the wage earner has steadily improved. \nThe 12-hour day is almost entirely unknown. Skilled labor is well compensated. \nBut there are unfortunately a multitude of workers who have not yet come to \nshare in the general prosperity of the Nation. Both the public authorities and \nprivate enterprise should be solicitous to advance the welfare of this class. \nThe Federal Government has been seeking to secure this end through a protective \ntariff, through restrictive immigration, through requiring safety devices for \nthe prevention of accidents, through the granting of workman's compensation, \nthrough civilian vocational rehabilitation and education, through employment \ninformation bureaus, and through such humanitarian relief as was provided in \nthe maternity and infancy legislation. It is a satisfaction to report that a \nmore general condition of contentment exists among wage earners and the country \nis more free from labor disputes than it has been for years. While restrictive \nimmigration has been adopted in part for the benefit of the wage earner, and \nin its entirety for the benefit of the country, it ought not to cause a needless \nseparation of families and dependents from their natural source of support contrary \nto the dictates of humanity.\nBITUMINOUS COAL\nNo progress appears to have been made within large areas of the bituminous \ncoal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which greater assurance \ncan be given to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage difficulties such \nas has been accomplished in the anthracite industry. This bituminous industry \nis one of primary necessity and bears a great responsibility to the Nation for \ncontinuity of supplies. As the wage agreements in the unionized section of the \nindustry expire on April 1 next, and as conflicts may result which may imperil \npublic interest, and have for many years often called for action of the Executive \nin protection of the public, I again recommend the passage of such legislation \nas will assist the Executive in dealing with such emergencies through a special \ntemporary board of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agencies \nfor the purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumers of coal \nfrom profiteering. At present the Executive is not only without authority to \nact but is actually prohibited by law from making any expenditure to meet the \nemergency of a coal famine.\nJUDICIARY\nThe Federal courts hold a high position in the administration of justice in \nthe world. While individual judicial officers have sometimes been subjected \nto just criticism, the courts as a whole have maintained an exceedingly high \nstandard. The Congress may well consider the question of supplying fair salaries \nand conferring upon the Supreme Court the same rule-making power on the law \nside of the district courts that they have always possessed on the equity side. \nA bill is also pending providing for retirement after a certain number of years \nof service, although they have not been consecutive, which should have your \nfavorable consideration. These faithful servants of the Government are about \nthe last that remain to be provided for in the postwar readjustments.\nBANKING\nThere has been pending in Congress for nearly three years banking legislation \nto clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the powers of the \nnational banks. I believe that within the limitation of sound banking principles \nCongress should now and for the future place the national banks upon a fair \nequality with their competitors, the State banks, and I trust that means may \nbe found so that the differences on branch-banking legislation between the Senate \nand the House of Representatives may be settled along sound lines and the legislation \npromptly enacted.\nIt would be difficult to overestimate the service which the Federal reserve \nsystem has already rendered to the country. It is necessary only to recall the \nchaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the Federal reserve \nsystem was put into operation. The old system consisted of a vast number of \nindependent banking units, with scattered bank reserves which never could be \nmobilized in times of greatest need. In spite of vast banking resources, there \nwas no coordination of reserves or any credit elasticity. As a consequence, \na strain was felt even during crop-moving periods and when it was necessary \nto meet other seasonal and regularly recurring needs.\nThe Federal reserve system is not a panacea for all economic or financial ills. \nIt can not prevent depression in certain industries which are experiencing overexpansion \nof production or contraction of their markets. Its business is to furnish adequate \ncredit and currency facilities. This it has succeeded in doing, both during \nthe war and in the more difficult period of deflation and readjustment which \nfollowed. It enables us to look to the future with confidence and to make plans \nfar ahead, based on the belief that the Federal reserve system will exercise \na steadying influence on credit conditions and thereby prevent tiny sudden or \nsevere reactions from the period of prosperity which we are now enjoying. In \norder that these plans may go forward, action should be taken at the present \nsession on the question of renewing the banks' charters and thereby insuring \na continuation of the policies and present usefulness of the Federal reserve \nsystem.\nFEDERAL REGULATION\nI am in favor of reducing, rather than expanding, Government bureaus which \nseek to regulate and control the business activities of the people. Everyone \nis aware that abuses exist and will exist so long as we are limited by human \nimperfections. Unfortunately, human nature can not be changed by an act of the \nlegislature. When practically the sole remedy for many evils lies in the necessity \nof the people looking out for themselves and reforming their own abuses, they \nwill find that they are relying on a false security if the Government assumes \nto hold out the promise that it is looking out for them and providing reforms \nfor them. This principle is preeminently applicable to the National Government. \nIt is too much assumed that because an abuse exists it is the business of the \nNational Government to provide a remedy. The presumption should be that it is \nthe business of local and State governments. Such national action results in \nencroaching upon the salutary independence of the States and by undertaking \nto supersede their natural authority fills the land with bureaus and departments \nwhich are undertaking to do what it is impossible for them to accomplish and \nbrings our whole system of government into disrespect and disfavor. We ought \nto maintain high standards. We ought to punish wrongdoing. Society has not only \nthe privilege but the absolute duty of protecting itself and its individuals. \nBut we can not accomplish this end by adopting a wrong method. Permanent success \nlies in local, rather than national action. Unless the locality rises to its \nown requirements, there is an almost irresistible impulse for the National Government \nto intervene. The States and the Nation should both realize that such action \nis to be adopted only as a last resort.\nTHE NEGRO\nThe social well-being of our country requires our constant effort for the amelioration \nof race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equal opportunity and \nequal protection under the laws which are guaranteed by the. Constitution. The \nFederal Government especially is charged with this obligation in behalf of the \ncolored people of the Nation. Not only their remarkable progress, their devotion \nand their loyalty, but, our duty to ourselves under our claim that we are an \nenlightened people requires us to use all our power to protect them from the \ncrime of lynching. Although violence of this kind has very much decreased, while \nany of it remains we can not justify neglecting to make every effort to eradicate \nit by law.\nThe education of the colored race under Government encouragement is proceeding \nsuccessfully and ought to have continuing support. An increasing need exists \nfor properly educated and trained medical skill to be devoted to the service \nof this race.\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS\nThis Government holds in sacred trusteeship islands which it has acquired in \nthe East and West Indies. In all of them the people are more prosperous than \nat any previous time. A system of good roads, education, and general development \nis in progress. The people are better governed than ever before and generally \ncontent.\nIn the Philippine Islands Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood has been Governor General \nfor five years and has administered his office with tact and ability greatly \nto the success of the Filipino people. These are a proud and sensitive race, \nwho are making such progress with our cooperation that we can view the results \nof this experiment with great satisfaction. As we are attempting to assist this \nrace toward self-government, we should look upon their wishes with great respect, \ngranting their requests immediately when they are right, yet maintaining a frank \nfirmness in refusing when they are wrong. We shall measure their progress in \nno small part by their acceptance of the terms of the organic law under which \nthe islands are governed and their faithful observance of its provisions. Need \nexists for clarifying the duties of the auditor and declaring them to be what \neveryone had supposed they were. We have placed our own expenditures under the \nsupervision of the Comptroller General. It is not likely that the expenditures \nin the Philippine Islands need less supervision than our own. The Governor General \nis hampered in his selection of subordinates by the necessity of securing a \nconfirmation, which has oftentimes driven him to the expediency of using Army \nofficers in work for which civilian experts would be much better fitted. Means \nshould be provided for this and such other purposes as he may require out of \nthe revenue which this Government now turns back to the Philippine treasury.\nIn order that these possessions might stiffer no seeming neglect, I have recently \nsent Col. Carmi A Thompson to the islands to make a survey in cooperation with \nthe Governor General to suggest what might be done to improve conditions. Later, \nI may make a more extended report including recommendations. The economic development \nof the islands is very important. They ought not to be turned back to the people \nuntil they are both politically fitted for self-government and economically \nindependent. Large areas are adaptable to the production of rubber. No one contemplates \nany time in the future either under the present or a more independent form of \ngovernment when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense. \nFor their economic advantage, for the employment of their people, and as a contribution \nto our power of defense which could not be carried on without rubber, I believe \nthis industry should be encouraged. It is especially adapted to the Filipino \npeople themselves, who might cultivate it individually on a small acreage. It \ncould be carried on extensively by American capital in a way to furnish employment \nat good wages. I am opposed to the promotion of any policy that does not provide \nfor absolute freedom on the part of the wage earners and do not think we should \nundertake to give power for large holdings of land in the islands against the \nopposition of the people of the locality. Any development of the islands must \nbe solely with the first object of benefiting the people of the islands. At \nan early day, these possessions should be taken out from under all military \ncontrol and administered entirely on the civil side of government.\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\nOur policy of national defense is not one of making war, but of insuring peace. \nThe land and sea force of America, both in its domestic and foreign implications, \nis distinctly a peace force. It is an arm of the police power to guarantee order \nand the execution of the law at home and security to our citizens abroad. No \nself-respecting nation would neglect to provide an army and navy proportionate \nto its population, the extent of its territory, and the dignity of the place \nwhich it occupies in the world. When it is considered that no navy in the world, \nwith one exception, approaches ours and none surpasses it, that our Regular \nArmy of about 115,000 men is the equal of any other like number of troops, that \nour entire permanent and reserve land and sea force trained and training consists \nof a personnel of about 610,000, and that our annual appropriations are about \n$680,000,000 a year, expended under the direction of an exceedingly competent \nstaff, it can not be said that our country is neglecting its national defense. \nIt is true that a cult of disparagement exists, but that candid examination \nmade by the Congress through its various committees has always reassured the \ncountry and demonstrated that it is maintaining the most adequate defensive \nforces in these present years that it has ever supported in time of peace.\nThis general policy should be kept in effect. Here and there temporary changes \nmay be made in personnel to meet requirements in other directions. Attention \nshould be given to submarines, cruisers, and air forces. Particular points may \nneed strengthening, but as a whole our military power is sufficient.\nThe one weak place in the whole line is our still stupendous war debt. In any \nmodern campaign the dollars are the shock troops. With a depleted treasury in \nthe rear, no army can maintain itself in the field. A country loaded with debt \nis a country devoid of the first line of defense. Economy is the handmaid of \npreparedness. If we wish to be able to defend ourselves to the full extent of \nour power in the future, we shall discharge as soon as possible the financial \nburden of the last war. Otherwise we would face a crisis with a part of our \ncapital resources already expended.\nThe amount and kind of our military equipment is preeminently a question for \nthe decision of the Congress, after giving due consideration to the advice of \nmilitary experts and the available public revenue. Nothing is more laudable \nthan the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial resources of the country \nfor the purpose of supplying the needs of national defense. In time of peril \nthe people employed in these interests volunteered in a most self-sacrificing \nway, often at the nominal charge of a dollar a year. But the Army and Navy are \nnot supported for the benefit of supply concerns; supply concerns are supported \nfor the benefit of the Army and Navy. The distribution of orders on what is \nneeded from different concerns for the purpose of keeping up equipment and organization \nis perfectly justified, but any attempt to prevail upon the Government to purchase \nbeyond its needs ought not to be tolerated. It is eminently fair that those \nwho deal with the Government should do so at a reasonable profit. However, public \nmoney is expended not that some one may profit by it, but in order to serve \na public purpose.\nWhile our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may be independent \nand self-sufficient, I am opposed to engaging in any attempt at competitive \narmaments. No matter how much or how little some other country may feel constrained \nto provide, we can well afford to set the example, not of being dictated to \nby others, but of adopting our own standards. We are strong enough to pursue \nthat method, which will be a most wholesome model for the rest of the world. \nWe are eminently peaceful, but we are by no means weak. While we submit our \ndifferences with others, not to the adjudication of force, but of reason, it \nis not because we are unable to defend our rights. While we are doing our best \nto eliminate all resort to war for the purpose of settling disputes, we can \nnot but remember that the peace we now enjoy had to be won by the sword and \nthat if the rights of our country are to be defended we can not rely for that \npurpose upon anyone but ourselves. We can not shirk the responsibility, which \nis the first requisite of all government, of preserving its own integrity and \nmaintaining the rights of its own citizens. It is only in accordance with these \nprinciples that we can establish any lasting foundations for an honorable and \npermanent peace.\nIt is for these reasons that our country, like any other country, proposes \nto provide itself with an army and navy supported by a merchant marine. Yet \nthese are not for competition with any other power. For years we have besought \nnations to disarm. We have recently expressed our willingness at Geneva to enter \ninto treaties for the limitation of all types of warships according to the ratio \nadopted at the Washington Conference. This offer is still pending. While we \nare and shall continue to be armed it is not as a menace, but rather a common \nassurance of tranquility to all the peaceloving people of the world. For us \nto do any less would be to disregard our obligations, evade our responsibilities, \nand jeopardize our national honor.\nVETERANS\nThis country, not only because it is bound by honor but because of the satisfaction \nderived from it, has always lavished its bounty upon its veterans. For years \na service pension has been bestowed upon the Grand Army on reaching a certain \nage. Like provision has been made for the survivors of the Spanish War. A liberal \nfuture compensation has been granted to all the veterans of the World War. But \nit is in the case of the, disabled and the dependents that the Government exhibits \nits greatest solicitude. This work is being well administered by the Veterans' \nBureau. The main unfinished feature is that of hospitalization. This requirement \nis being rapidly met. Various veteran bodies will present to you recommendations \nwhich should have your careful consideration. At the last session we increased \nour annual expenditure for pensions and relief on account of the veterans of \nthree wars. While I approve of proper relief for all suffering, I do not favor \nany further extension of our pension system at this time.\nALIEN PROPERTY\nWe still have in the possession of the Government the alien property. It has \nalways been the policy of America to hold that private enemy property should \nnot be confiscated in time of war. This principle we have scrupulously observed. \nAs this property is security for the claims of our citizens and our Government, \nwe can not relinquish it without adequate provision for their reimbursement. \nLegislation for the return of this property, accompanied by suitable provisions \nfor the liquidation of the claims of our citizens and our Treasury, should be \nadopted. If our Government releases to foreigners the security which it holds \nfor Americans, it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguards for \nmeeting American claims.\nPROHIBITION\nThe duly authorized public authorities of this country have made prohibition \nthe law of the land. Acting under the Constitution the Congress and the legislatures \nof practically all the, States have adopted legislation for its enforcement. \nSome abuses have arisen which require reform. Under the law the National Government \nhas entrusted to the Treasury Department the especial duty of regulation and \nenforcement. Such supplementary legislation as it requires to meet existing \nconditions should be carefully and speedily enacted. Failure to support the \nConstitution and observe the law ought not to be tolerated by public opinion. \nEspecially those in public places, who have taken their oath to support the \nConstitution, ought to be most scrupulous in its observance. Officers of the \nDepartment of Justice throughout the country should be vigilant in enforcing \nthe law, but local authorities, which had always been mainly responsible for \nthe enforcement of law in relation to intoxicating liquor, ought not to seek \nevasion by attempting to shift the burden wholly upon the Federal agencies. \nUnder the Constitution the States are jointly charged with the Nation in providing \nfor the enforcement of the prohibition amendment. Some people do not like the \namendment, some do not like other parts of the Constitution, some do not like \nany of it. Those who entertain such sentiments have a perfect right to seek \nthrough legal methods for a change. But for any of our inhabitants to observe \nsuch parts of the Constitution as they like, while disregarding others, is a \ndoctrine that would break down all protection of life and property and destroy \nthe American system of ordered liberty.\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\nThe foreign policy of this Government is well known. It is one of peace based \non that mutual respect that arises from mutual regard for international rights \narid the discharge of international obligations. It is our purpose to promote \nunderstanding and good will between ourselves and all other people. The American \npeople are altogether lacking in an appreciation of the tremendous good fortune \nthat surrounds their international position. We have no traditional enemies. \nWe are not embarrassed over any disputed territory. We have no possessions that \nare coveted by others; they have none that are coveted by us. Our borders are \nunfortified. We fear no one; no one fears us. All the world knows that the whole \nextent of our influence is against war and in favor of peace, against the use \nof force and in favor of negotiation, arbitration, and adjudication as a method \nof adjusting international differences. We look with disfavor upon all aggressive \nwarfare. We are strong enough so that no one can charge us with weakness if \nwe are slow to anger. Our place is sufficiently established so that we need \nnot be sensitive over trifles. Our resources, are large enough so that we can \nafford to be generous. At the same time we are a nation among nations and recognize \na responsibility not only to ourselves, but in the interests of a stable and \nenlightened civilization, to protect and defend the international rights of \nour Government and our citizens.\nIt is because of our historical detachment and the generations of comparative \nindifference toward it by other nations that our public is inclined to consider \naltogether too seriously the reports that we are criticized abroad. We never \nhad a larger foreign trade than at the present time. Our good offices were never \nmore sought and the necessity for our assistance and cooperation was never more \nuniversally declared in any time of peace. We know that the sentiments which \nwe entertain toward all other nations are those of the most sincere friendship \nand good will and of all unbounded desire to help, which we are perfectly willing \nto have judged by their fruits. In our efforts to adjust our international obligations \nwe have met with a response which, when everything is considered, I believe \nhistory will record as a most remarkable and gratifying demonstration of the \nsanctity with which civilized nations undertake to discharge their mutual obligations. \nDebt settlements have been negotiated with practically all of those who owed \nus and all finally adjusted but two, which are, in process of ratification. \nWhen we consider the real sacrifice that will be necessary on the part of other \nnations, considering all their circumstances, to meet their agreed payments, \nwe ought to hold them in increased admiration and respect. It is true that we \nhave extended to them very generous treatment, but it is also true that they \nhave agreed to repay its all that we loaned to them and some interest.\nA special conference on the Chinese customs tariff provided for by the \ntreaty between the nine powers relating to the Chinese customs tariff signed \nat Washington on February 6, 1922, was called by the Chinese Government to meet \nat Peking, on October 26, 1925. We participated in this conference through fully \nempowered delegates and, with good will, endeavored to cooperate with the other \nparticipating powers with a view to putting into effect promises made to China \nat the Washington conference, and considering any reasonable proposal that might \nbe made by the Chinese Government for the revision of the treaties on the subject \nof China's tariff. With these aims in view the American delegation at the outset \nof the conference proposed to put into effect the surtaxes provided for by the \nWashington treaty and to proceed immediately to the negotiation of a treaty, \nwhich, among other things, was to make provision for the abolition of taxes \ncollected on goods in transit, remove the tariff restrictions in existing treaties, \nand put into effect the national tariff law of China.\nEarly in April of the present year the central Chinese Government was ousted \nfrom power by opposing warring factions. It became impossible under the circumstances \nto continue the negotiations. Finally, on July 3, the delegates of the foreign \npowers, including those of the United States, issued a statement expressing \ntheir unanimous and earnest desire to proceed with the work of the conference \nat the earliest possible moment when the delegates of the Chinese Government \nare in a position to resume discussions with the foreign delegates of the problems \nbefore the conference. We are prepared to resume the negotiations thus interrupted \nwhenever a Government representing the Chinese people and acting on their behalf \npresents itself. The fact that constant warfare between contending Chinese factions \nhas rendered it impossible to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion \nis a matter of deep regret. Throughout these conflicts we have maintained a \nposition of the most careful neutrality. Our naval vessels in Asiatic waters, \npursuant to treaty rights, have been used only for the protection of American \ncitizens.\nSilas H. Strawn, Esq., was sent to China as American commissioner to cooperate \nwith commissioners of the other powers in the establishment of a commission \nto inquire into the present practice of extraterritorial jurisdiction in China, \nwith a view to reporting to the Governments of the several powers their findings \nof fact in regard to these matters. The commission commenced its work in January, \n1926, and agreed upon a joint report which was signed on September 16, 1926. \nThe commission's report has been received and is being studied with a view to \ndetermining our future policy in regard to the question of extraterritorial \nprivileges under treaties between the United States and China.\nThe Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference met at Geneva on \nMay 18 and its work has been proceeding almost continuously since that date. \nIt would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to the progress that \nhas been made. The commission has had before it a comprehensive list of questions \ntouching upon all aspects of the question of the limitation of armament. \nIn the commission's discussions many differences of opinion have developed. \nHowever, I am hopeful that at least some measure of agreement will be reached \nas the discussions continue. The American representation on the commission has \nconsistently tried to be helpful, and has kept before it the practical objective \nto which the commission is working, namely, actual agreements for the limitation \nof armaments. Our representatives will continue their work in that direction.\nOne of the most encouraging features of the commission's work thus far has \nbeen the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority of the \npowers parties to the Washington treaty limiting naval armament upon methods \nand standards for the comparison and further limitation of naval armament. It \nis needless to say that at the proper time I shall be prepared to proceed along \npractical lines to the conclusion of agreements carrying further the work begun \nat the Washington Conference in 1921.\nDEPARTMENT REPORTS\nMany important subjects which it is impossible even to mention in the short \nspace of an annual message you will find fully discussed in the departmental \nreports. A failure to include them here is not to be taken as indicating any \nlack of interest, but only a disinclination to state inadequately what has been \nmuch better done in other documents.\nTHE CAPITAL CITY\nWe are embarking on an ambitious building program for the city of Washington. \nThe Memorial Bridge is under way with all that it holds for use and beauty. \nNew buildings are soon contemplated. This program should represent the \nbest that exists in the art and science of architecture. Into these structures \nwhich must be considered as of a permanent nature ought to go the aspirations \nof the Nation, its ideals expressed in forms of beauty. If our country wishes \nto compete with others, let it not be in the support of armaments but in the \nmaking of a beautiful capital city. Let it express the soul of America. Whenever \nan American is at the seat of his Government, however traveled and cultured \nhe may be, he ought to find a city of stately proportion, symmetrically laid \nout and adorned with the best that there is in architecture, which would arouse \nhis imagination and stir his patriotic pride. In the coming years Washington \nshould be not only the art center of our own country but the art center of the \nworld. Around it should center all that is best in science, in learning, in \nletters, and in art. These are the results that justify the creation of those \nnational resources with which we have been favored.\nAMERICAN IDEALS\nAmerica is not and must not be a country without ideals. They are useless if \nthey are only visionary; they are only valuable if they are practical. A nation \ncan not dwell constantly on the mountain tops. It has to be replenished and \nsustained through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiring valleys. But its \nface ought always to be turned upward, its vision ought always to be fixed on \nhigh.\nWe need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translated into \nterms of the home. We can not expect to be relieved from toil, but we do expect \nto divest it of degrading conditions. Work is honorable; it is entitled to an \nhonorable recompense. We must strive mightily, but having striven there is a \ndefect in our political and social system if we are not in general rewarded \nwith success. To relieve the land of the burdens that came from the war, to \nrelease to the individual more of the fruits of his own industry, to increase \nhis earning capacity and decrease his hours of labor, to enlarge the circle \nof his vision through good roads and better transportation, to lace before him \nthe opportunity for education both in science and in art, to leave him free \nto receive the inspiration of religion, all these are ideals which deliver him \nfrom the servitude of the body and exalt him to the service of the soul. Through \nthis emancipation from the things that are material, we broaden our dominion \nover the things that are spiritual."
