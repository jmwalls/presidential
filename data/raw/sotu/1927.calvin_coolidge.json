  "text": "Members of the Congress:\nIt is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state of \nthe Union in general is good. We are at peace. The country as a whole has had \na prosperity never exceeded. Wages are at their highest range, employment is \nplentiful. Some parts of agriculture and industry have lagged; some localities \nhave suffered from storm and flood. But such losses have been absorbed without \nserious detriment to our great economic structure. Stocks of goods are moderate \nand a wholesome caution is prevalent. Rates of interest for industry, agriculture, \nand government have been reduced. Savers and investors are providing capital \nfor new construction in industry and public works. The purchasing power of agriculture \nhas increased. If the people maintain that confidence which they are entitled \nto have in themselves, in each other, and in America, a comfortable prosperity \nwill continue.\nCONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMY\nWithout constructive economy in Government expenditures we should not now be \nenjoying these results or these prospects. Because we are not now physically \nat war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debt still remains. \nThe Nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by a stern self-denial \nin public expenditures, until we have conquered the disabilities of our public \nfinance. While our obligation to veterans and dependents is large and continuing, \nthe heavier burden of the national debt is being steadily eliminated. At the \nend of this fiscal year it will be reduced from about $26,600,000,000 to about \n$17,975,000,000. Annual interest, including war savings, will have been reduced \nfrom $1,055,000,000 to $670,0001,000. The sacrifices of the people, the economy \nof the Government, are showing remarkable results. They should be continued \nfor the purpose of relieving the Nation of the burden of interest and debt and \nreleasing revenue for internal improvements and national development.\nNot only the amount, but the rate, of Government interest has been reduced. \nCallable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year the average \nrate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell below 4 \nper cent. Keeping the credit of the Nation high is a tremendously profitable \noperation.\nTAX REDUCTION\nThe immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax \nreduction. The annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is $212,000,000. \nWithout this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth proposing. The \nthree measures already enacted leave our Government revenues where they are \nnot oppressive. Exemptions, have been increased until 115,000,000 people \nmake but 2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so that further reduction should \nbe mainly for the purpose of removing inequalities. The Secretary of the Treasury \nhas recommended a measure which would give us a much better balanced system \nof taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue. It has \nmy complete support.\nUnforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. Our probable surplus \nfor June 30, 1929, is small. A slight depression in business would greatly reduce \nour revenue because of our present method of taxation. The people ought to take \nno selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate and fair taxes which might \nproduce a deficit. We must keep our budget balanced for each year. That \nis the corner stone of our national credit, the trifling price we pay to command \nthe lowest rate of interest of any great power in the world. Any surplus can \nbe applied to debt reduction, and debt reduction is tax reduction. Under the \npresent circumstances it would be far better to leave the rates as they are \nthan to enact a bill carrying the peril of a deficit. This is not a problem \nto be approached in a narrow or partisan spirit. All of those who participate \nin finding a reasonable solution will be entitled to participate in any credit \nthat accrues from it without regard to party. The Congress has already demonstrated \nthat tax legislation can be removed from purely political consideration into \nthe realm of patriotic business principles.\nAny bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible for \nraising, managing, and expending the finances of the Government. If special \ninterests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the national needs as a whole, \nwith hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of propaganda, \nare permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation, we \nshall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust, bad for business, bad for the \ncountry, probably resulting in a deficit, with disastrous financial Consequences. \nThe Constitution has given the Members of the Congress sole authority to decide \nwhat tax measures shall be presented for approval. While welcoming information \nfrom any quarter, the Congress should continue to exercise its own judgment \nin a matter so vital and important to all the interests of the country as taxation.\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\nBeing a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, to \nmaintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in a \nform adapted solely to defense. It should be continued with a very generous \nsupply of officers and with the present base of personnel, subject to fluctuations \nwhich may be temporarily desirable.\nThe five-year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same policy \nand commensurate with the notable contributions of America to the science of \naeronautics. The provisions of the law lately enacted are being executed as \nfast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable development permit.\nWhile our Army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a high \nstate of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its immediate \nexpansion. The garrison ration has lately been increased. Recommendations for \nan appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made to the previous Congress \nfailed to pass. While most of the Army is well housed, some of it which is quartered \nin wartime training camps is becoming poorly housed. In the past three years \n$12,533,000 have been appropriated for reconstruction and repairs, and an authorization \nhas been approved of $22,301,000 for new housing, under which $8,070,000 has \nalready been appropriated. A law has also been passed, complying with the request \nof the War Department, allocating funds received from the sale of buildings \nand land for housing purposes. The work, however, is not completed, so that \nother appropriations are being recommended.\nOur Navy is likewise a weapon of defense. We have a foreign commerce and ocean \nlines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. We have outlying territory \nin the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded with the richest \ncities in the world. We are responsible for the protection of a large population \nand the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any people. We are charged with \nan international duty of defending the Panama Canal. To meet these responsibilities \nwe need a very substantial sea armament. It needs aircraft development, which \nis being provided under the five-year program. It needs submarines as soon as \nthe department decides upon the best type of construction. It needs airplane \ncarriers and a material addition to its force of cruisers. We can plan for the \nfuture and begin a moderate building program.\nThis country has put away the Old World policy of competitive armaments. It \ncan never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense. We \nhave one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part \nfor a limitation in naval armament. After most careful preparation, extending \nover months, we recently made every effort to secure a three-power treaty to \nthe same end. We were granted much cooperation by Japan, but we were unable \nto come to an agreement with Great Britain. While the results of the conference \nwere of considerable value, they were mostly of a negative character. We know \nnow that no agreement can be reached which will be inconsistent with a considerable \nbuilding program on our part. We are ready and willing to continue the preparatory \ninvestigations on the general subject of limitation of armaments which have \nbeen started under the auspices of the League of Nations.\nWe have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete. Everyone \nknew that had a three-power agreement been reached it would have left us with \nthe necessity of continuing our building program. The failure to agree should \nnot cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise should. Any future \ntreaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. We should enter on no competition. \nWe should refrain from no needful program. It should be made clear to all the \nworld that lacking a definite agreement, the attitude of any other country is \nnot to be permitted to alter our own policy. It should especially be demonstrated \nthat propaganda will not cause us to change our course. Where there is no treaty \nlimitation, the size of the Navy which America is to have will be solely for \nAmerica to determine. No outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it. \nBut it should be known to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement. \nIt is a guaranty of peace and security at home, and when it goes abroad it is \nan instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens under international \nlaw, a refuge in time of disorder, and always the servant of world peace. Wherever \nour flag goes the rights of humanity increase.\nMERCHANT MARINE\nThe United States Government fleet is transporting a large amount of freight \nand reducing its drain on the Treasury. The Shipping Board is constantly under \npressure, to which it too often yields, to protect private interests, rather \nthan serve the public welfare. More attention should be given to merchant ships \nas an auxiliary of the Navy. The possibility of including their masters and \ncrews in the Naval Reserve, with some reasonable compensation, should be thoroughly \nexplored as a method of encouraging private operation of shipping. Public \noperation is not a success. No investigation, of which I have caused several \nto be made, has failed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy \ntransfer to private ownership. Our exporters and importers are both indifferent \nabout using American ships. It should be our policy to keep our present vessels \nin repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible, rather than undertake \nany new construction. Their operation is a burden on the National Treasury, \nfor which we are not receiving sufficient benefits.\nCOMMERCIAL AVIATION\nA rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. The Department of Commerce \nhas charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national \nairways. Almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000 miles more \ncontemplated. Nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000 miles \nmore will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next July. Air mail \ncontracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines. Daily airway flying is nearly \n15,000 miles and is expected to reach 25,000 miles early next year.\nFlights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. Over 900 airports, \ncompleted and uncompleted, have been laid out. The demand for aircraft has greatly \nincreased. The policy already adopted by the Congress is producing the sound \ndevelopment of this coming industry.\nWESTERN HEMISPHERE AIR MAIL\nPrivate enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service \nto Mexico and Central and South America. We are particularly solicitous to have \nthe United States take a leading part in this development. It is understood \nthat the governments of our sister countries would be willing to cooperate. \nTheir physical features, the undeveloped state of their transportation, make \nan air service especially adaptable to their usage. The Post Office Department \nshould be granted power to make liberal long-term contracts for carrying our \nmail, and authority should be given to the Army and the Navy to detail aviators \nand planes to cooperate with private enterprise in establishing such mail service \nwith the consent of the countries concerned. A committee of the Cabinet will \nlater present a report on this subject.\nGOOD ROADS\nThe importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be appreciated. \nThe National Government has been making liberal contributions to encourage their \nconstruction. The results and benefits have been very gratifying. National participation, \nhowever, should be confined to trunk-line systems. The national tax on automobiles \nis now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay. This tax is very small, and on \nlow-priced cars is not more than $2 or $3 each year.\nWhile the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire for improved \nhighways is not limited to our own country. It should and does include all the \nWestern Hemisphere. The principal points in Canada are already accessible. We \nought to lend our encouragement in any way we can for more good roads to all \nthe principal points in this hemisphere south of the Rio Grande. It has been \nour practice to supply these countries with military and naval advisers, when \nthey have requested it, to assist them in national defense. The arts of peace \nare even more important to them and to us. Authority should be given by law \nto provide them at their request with engineering advisers for the construction \nof roads and bridges. In some of these countries already wonderful progress \nis being made in road building, but the engineering features are often very \nexacting and the financing difficult. Private interests should look with favor \non all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open such main lines of \ntravel.\nThis general subject has been promoted by the Pan American Congress of Highways, \nwhich will convene again at Rio de Janeiro in July, 1928. It is desirable that \nthe Congress should provide for the appointment of delegates to represent the \nGovernment of the United States.\nCUBAN PARCEL POST\nWe have a temporary parcel-post convention with Cuba. The advantage of it is \nall on our side. During 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels, weighing \ntwenty-four times as much, as we received. This convention was made on the understanding \nthat we would repeal an old law prohibiting the importation of cigars and cigarettes \nin quantities less than 3,000 enacted in 1866 to discourage smuggling, for which \nit has long been unnecessary. This law unjustly discriminates against an important \nindustry of Cuba. Its repeal has been recommended by the Treasury and Post Office \nDepartments. Unless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselves \ndeprived of this large parcel-post business after the 1st of next March, the \ndate of the expiration of the convention, which has been extended upon the specific \nunderstanding that it would expire at that time unless this legislation was \nenacted. We purchase large quantities of tobacco made in Cuba. It is not probable \nthat our purchases would be any larger if this law was repealed, while it would \nbe an advantage to many other industries in the United States.\nINSULAR POSSESSIONS\nConditions in the Philippine Islands have been steadily improved. Contentment \nand good order prevail. Roads, irrigation works, harbor improvements, and public \nbuildings are being constructed. Public education and sanitation have been advanced. \nThe Government is in a sound financial condition. These immediate results were \nespecially due to the administration of Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood. The six years \nof his governorship marked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as \none of the outstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man. His death \nis a loss to the Nation and the islands.\nGreater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put. into administration, \nif the Congress would undertake to expend, through its appropriating power, \nall or a part of the customs revenues which are now turned over to the Philippine \ntreasury. The powers of the auditor of the islands also need revision and clarification. \nThe government of the islands is about 98 per cent in the hands of the Filipinos. \nAn extension of the policy of self-government will be hastened by the demonstration \non their part of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and efficiently \nthe provisions of the organic law enacted by the Congress for the government \nof the islands. It would be well for a committee of the Congress to visit the \nislands every two years.\nA fair degree of progress is being made in Porto Rico. Its agricultural products \nare increasing; its treasury position, which has given much concern, shows improvement. \nI am advised by the governor that educational facilities are still lacking. \nRoads are being constructed, which he represents are the first requisite for \nbuilding schoolhouses. The loyalty of the island to the United States is exceedingly \ngratifying. A memorial will be presented to you requesting authority to have \nthe governor elected by the people of Porto Rico. This was never done in the \ncase of our own Territories. It is admitted that education outside of the towns \nis as yet very deficient. Until it has progressed further the efficiency of \nthe government and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of \nan appointed governor. As it is not contemplated that any change should be made \nimmediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the Congress.\nPANAMA CANAL\nThe number of commercial ships passing through the Panama Canal has increased \nfrom 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927. The total amount of tolls turned into the \nTreasury is over $166,000,000, while all the operations of the canal have yielded \na surplus of about $80,000,000. In order to provide additional storage of water \nand give some control over the floods of the Chagres River, it is proposed to \nerect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 at Alhajuela. It will take some five years \nto complete this work.\nAGRICULTURE\nThe past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture. \nProduction is better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus. Costs \nhave been reduced and the average output of the worker increased. The level \nof farm prices has risen while others have fallen, so that the purchasing power \nof the farmer is approaching a normal figure. The individual farmer is entitled \nto great credit for the progress made since 1921. He has adjusted his production \nand through cooperative organizations and other methods improved his marketing. \nHe is using authenticated facts and employing sound methods which other industries \nare obliged to use to secure stability and prosperity. The old-fashioned haphazard \nsystem is being abandoned, economics are being applied to ascertain the best \nadapted unit of land, diversification is being promoted, and scientific methods \nare being used in production, and business principles in marketing.\nAgriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. The fact is that \neconomic progress never marches forward in a straight line. It goes in waves. \nOne part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes. Everybody wishes \nagriculture to prosper. Any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will \nhave the earnest support of the Government. Their interests are not all identical. \nLegislation should assist as many producers in as many regions as possible. \nIt should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own salvation socially \nand economically. No plan will be of any permanent value to him which does not \nleave him standing on his own foundation.\nIn the past the Government has spent vast sums to bring land under cultivation. \nlt. is apparent that this has reached temporarily the saturation point. We have \nhad a surplus of production and a poor market for land, which has only lately \nshown signs of improvement. The main problem which is presented for solution \nis one of dealing with a surplus of production. It is useless to propose a temporary \nexpedient. What is needed is permanency and stability. Government price fixing \nis known to be unsound and bound to result in disaster. A Government subsidy \nwould work out in the same way. It can not be sound for all of the people to \nhire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the \nrest of the people want.\nPrice fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead of diminishing \nit. Putting the Government directly into business is merely a combination of \nsubsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure. These expedients \nwould lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and how much he should \nplant and where he should plant it, and what and how much he should sell and \nwhere he should sell it. The most effective means of dealing with surplus crops \nis to reduce the surplus acreage. While this can not be done by the individual \nfarmer, it can be done through the organizations already in existence, through \nthe information published by the Department of Agriculture, and especially through \nbanks and others who supply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly \ntoo large.\nIt is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for \nall those who engage in farming. If acreage becomes overextended, the Government \ncan not assume responsibility for it. The Government can, however, assist \ncooperative associations and other organizations in orderly marketing and handling \na surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions, in order to save the \nproducer from preventable loss. While it is probably impossible to secure this \nresult at a single step, and much will have to be worked out by trial and rejection, \na beginning could be made by setting up a Federal board or commission of able \nand experienced men in marketing, granting equal advantages under this board \nto the various agricultural commodities and sections of the country, giving \nencouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture, and providing a revolving \nloan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing. Such legislation \nwould lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem.\nThis is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is already fairly \nwell financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing associations \nwhich will no doubt ultimately be financed by the regularly established banks, \nas were the temporary operations of the War Finance Corporation. Cooperative \nmarketing especially would be provided with means of buying or building physical \nproperties.\nThe National Government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income \ntaxes by successive tax reductions, but State and local taxes have increased, \nputting on him a grievous burden. A policy of rigid economy should be applied \nto State and local expenditures. This is clearly within the legislative domain \nof the States. The Federal Government has also improved our banking structure \nand system of agricultural credits. The farmer will be greatly benefited by \nsimilar action in many States. The Department of Agriculture is undergoing changes \nin organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory \ndivisions, that each may be better administered. More emphasis is being placed \non the research program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for State \nexperiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work of \nthe department. It is in this direction that much future progress can be expected.\nTHE PROTECTIVE TARIFF\nThe present tariff rates supply the National Treasury with well over $600,000,000 \nof annual revenue. Yet, about 65 per cent of our imports come in duty free. \nOf the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are laid about 23 per \ncent consists of luxuries and agricultural products, and the balance of about \n12 per cent, amounting, to around $560,000,000 is made up of manufactures and \nmerchandise. As no one is advocating any material reduction in the rates on \nagriculture or luxuries, it is only the comparatively small amount of about \n$560,000,000 of other imports that are really considered in any discussion of \nreducing tariff rates. While this amount, duty free, would be large enough seriously \nto depress many lines of business in our own country, it is of small importance \nwhen spread over the rest of the world.\nIt is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would benefit \nagriculture. It would be interesting to know to what commodities it is thought \nthis could be applied. Everything the farmer uses in farming is already on the \nfree list. Nearly everything he sells is protected. It would seem to be obvious \nthat it is better for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the \ndomestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer. In one case our country \nwould have only the farmer; in the other it would have the farmer and the manufacturer. \nAssuming that Europe would have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise, \nit is not certain it would consume more food, or, if it did, that its purchases \nwould be made in this country. Undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapest market, \nwhich is by no means ours. The largest and best and most profitable market for \nthe farmer in the world is our own domestic market. Any great increase in manufactured \nimports means the closing of our own plants. Nothing would be worse for agriculture.\nProbably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures while \nmaintaining the rates on agriculture. A material reduction in either would be \ndisastrous to tile farmer. It would mean a general shrinkage of values, a deflation \nof prices, a reduction of wages, a general depression carrying our people down \nto the low standard of living in our competing countries. It is obvious that \nthis would not improve but destroy our market for imports, which is best served \nby maintaining our present high purchasing power under which in the past five \nyears imports have increased 63 per cent.\nFARM LOAN SYSTEM\nIt is exceedingly important that the Federal land and joint-stock land banks \nshould furnish the best possible service for agriculture. Certain joint-stock \nbanks have fallen into improper and unsound practices, resulting in the indictment \nof the officials of three of them. More money has been provided for examinations, \nand at the instance of the Treasury rules and regulations of the Federal Farm \nBoard have been revised. Early last May three of its members resigned. Their \nplaces were filled with men connected with the War Finance Corporation. Eugene \nMeyer being designated as Farm Loan Commissioner. The new members have demonstrated \ntheir ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations \nof he War Finance Corporation. Three joint-stock banks have gone into receivership. \nIt is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to \nfind a market for their bonds. A recent flotation was made at a record low rate \nof 4 per cent. Careful supervision is absolutely necessary to protect the investor \nand enable these banks to exercise their chief function in serving agriculture.\nMUSCLE SHOALS\nThe last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of Muscle \nShoals. Development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be produced \nat less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. Extensive investigation \nmade by the Department of War indicates that the nitrate plants on this project \nare of little value for national defense and can probably be disposed of within \ntwo years. The oxidation part of the plants, however, should be retained indefinitely. \nThis leaves this project mostly concerned with power. It should, nevertheless, \ncontinue to be dedicated to agriculture. It is probable that this desire can \nbe best served by disposing of the plant and applying the revenues received \nfrom it to research for methods of more economical production of concentrated \nfertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its use on \nthe farm. But in disposing of the property preference should be given to proposals \nto use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing.\nFLOOD CONTROL\nFor many years the Federal Government has been building a system of dikes along \nthe Mississippi River for protection against high water. During the past season \nthe lower States were overcome by a most disastrous flood. Many thousands of \nsquare miles were inundated a great many lives were lost, much livestock was \ndrowned, and a very heavy destruction of property was inflicted upon the inhabitants. \nThe American Red Cross at once went to the relief of the stricken communities. \nAppeals for contributions have brought in over $17,000,000. The Federal Government \nhas provided services, equipment, and supplies probably amounting to about $7,000,000 \nmore. Between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by local \nrailroads, the States, and their political units. Credits have been arranged \nby the Farm Loan Board, and three emergency finance corporations with a total \ncapital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to the extent of $12,000,000. \nThrough these means the 700,000 people in the flooded areas have been adequately \nsupported. Provision has been made to care for those in need until after the \n1st of January.\nThe Engineering Corps of the Army has contracted to close all breaks in the \ndike system before the next season of high water. A most thorough and elaborate \nsurvey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a report with recommendations \nfor future flood control, which will be presented to the Congress. The carrying \nout of their plans will necessarily extend over a series of years. They will \ncall for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency \nspillway's and improvements for the benefit of navigation.\nUnder the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one-third of \nthe cost of their construction. This has been a most extraordinary concession \nfrom the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where the general rule has \nbeen that the land benefited should bear the entire expense. It is true, of \ncourse, that the troublesome waters do not originate on the land to be reclaimed, \nbut it is also true that such waters have a right of way through that section \nof the country and the land there is charged with that easement. It is the land \nof this region that is to be benefited. To say that it is unable to bear any \nexpense of reclamation is the same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. \nBecause of expenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it \nseems probable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion \nof cost which it should bear. But it is extremely important that it should \npay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some responsibility \nfor their cost, and the neighborhood where works are constructed have a pecuniary \ninterest in preventing waste and extravagance and securing a wise and economical \nexpenditure of public funds.\nIt is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. It has \nbeen so treated from its inception. Our whole people have provided with great \ngenerosity for its relief. Most of the departments of the Federal Government \nhave been engaged in the same effort. The governments of the afflicted areas, \nboth State and municipal, can not be given too high praise for the courageous \nand helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people. If the \nsources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, the National Government \nshould not fail to provide generous relief. This, however, does not mean restoration. \nThe Government is not an insurer of its citizens against the hazard of the elements. \nWe shall always have flood and drought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, \nlightning and tidal wave, which are all too constant in their afflictions. The \nGovernment does not undertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage \nincurred under such circumstances. It is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding \nof public works and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress.\nThe people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached this \nproblem in the most generous and broad-minded way. They should be met with a \nlike spirit on the part of the National government. This is all one country. \nThe public needs of each part must be provided for by the public at large. No \nrequired relief should be refused. An adequate plan should be adopted to prevent \na recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity \nand comfort their fields and their towns.\nLegislation by this Congress should be confined to our principal and most pressing \nproblem, the lower Mississippi, considering tributaries only so far as they \nmaterially affect the main flood problem. A definite Federal program relating \nto our waterways was proposed when the last Congress authorized a comprehensive \nsurvey of all the important streams of the country in order to provide for their \nimprovement, including flood control, navigation, power, and irrigation. Other \nlegislation should wait pending a report on this survey. The recognized needs \nof the Mississippi should not be made a vehicle for carrying other projects. \nAll proposals for development should stand on their own merits. Any other method \nwould result in ill-advised conclusions, great waste of money, and instead of \npromoting would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources.\nVery recently several of the New England States have suffered somewhat similarly \nfrom heavy rainfall and high water. No reliable estimate of damage has yet been \ncomputed, but it is very large to private and public property. The Red Cross \nis generously undertaking what is needed for immediate relief, repair and reconstruction \nof houses, restocking of domestic animals, and food, clothing, and shelter. \nA considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channels in \nthe Department of Agriculture for reconstruction of highways. It may be necessary \nto grant special aid for this purpose. Complete reports of what is required \nwill undoubtedly be available early in the session.\nINLAND NAVIGATION\nThe Congress in its last session authorized the general improvements necessary \nto provide the Mississippi waterway system with better transportation. Stabilization \nof the levels of the Great Lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective \nshipway remain to be considered. Since the last session the Board of Engineers \nof the War Department has made a report on the proposal for a canal through \nthe State of New York, and the Joint Board of Engineers, representing Canada \nand the United States, has finished a report on the St. Lawrence River. Both \nof these boards conclude that the St. Lawrence project is cheaper, affords a \nmore expeditious method of placing western products in European markets, and \nwill cost less to operate. The State Department has requested the Canadian Government \nto negotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement. It will also \nbe necessary to secure an agreement with Canada to put in works necessary to \nprevent fluctuation in the levels of the Great Lakes.\nLegislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at Boulder Canyon on \nthe Colorado River, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation. A \nsecondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic \nwater supply for southern California. Flood control is clearly a national problem, \nand water supply is a Government problem, but every other possibility should \nbe exhausted before the Federal Government becomes engaged in the power business. \nThe States which are interested ought to reach mutual agreement. This project \nis in reality their work. If they wish the Federal Government to undertake it, \nthey should not hesitate to make the necessary concessions to each other. This \nsubject is fully discussed in the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. \nThe Columbia River Basin project is being studied and will be one to be considered \nat some future time.\nThe Inland Waterways Corporation is proving successful and especially beneficial \nto agriculture. A survey is being made to determine its future needs. It has \nnever been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to navigation it would \nthen be necessary for the Federal Government to provide the navigation. Such \na request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation \nis not profitable, that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken \nat a cheaper rate by some other method, in which case the hundreds of millions \nof dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be \nnot only wasted, but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the \ncommodities of private persons for less than cost.\nThe policy is well established that the Government should open public highways \non land and on water, but for use of the public in their private capacity. It \nhas put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with the expectation that \nif they prove profitable they would pass into private hands and if they do not \nprove profitable they will be withdrawn. The problems of transportation over \ninland waterways should be taken up by private enterprise, so that the public \nwill have the advantage of competition in service. It is expected that some \nof our lines can be sold, some more demonstration work done, and that with the \ncompletion of the Ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully developed.\nPROHIBITION\nAfter more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted a system \nof national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an amendment to \nthe Federal Constitution. In obedience to this mandate the Congress and the \nStates, with one or two notable exceptions, have passed required laws for its \nadministration and enforcement. This imposes upon the citizenship of the country, \nand especially on all public officers, not only the duty to enforce, but the \nobligation to observe the sanctions of this constitutional provision and its \nresulting laws. If this condition could be secured, all question concerning \nprohibition would cease. The Federal Government is making every effort to accomplish \nthese results through careful organization, large appropriations, and administrative \neffort. Smuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources of supply for \nillegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and criminal prosecution \nthe process of enforcement is being applied. The same vigilance on the part \nof local governments would render these efforts much more successful. The Federal \nauthorities propose to discharge their obligation for enforcement to the full \nextent of their ability.\nTHE NEGRO\nHistory does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length of \ntime as that which has been accomplished by the Negro race in the United States \nsince the Emancipation Proclamation. They have come up from slavery to be prominent \nin education, the professions, art, science, agriculture, banking, and commerce. \nIt is estimated that 50,000 of them are on the Government pay rolls, drawing \nabout $50,000,000 each year. They have been the recipients of presidential appointments \nand their professional ability has arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that \nthey have been intrusted with the entire management and control of the great \nveterans hospital at Tuskegee, where their conduct has taken high rank. They \nhave shown that they have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have \nreceived. Nevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsiderate \ntreatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. They have especially \nbeen made the target of the foul crime of lynching. For several years these \nacts of unlawful violence had been diminishing. In the last year they have shown \nan increase. Every principle of order and law and liberty is opposed to this \ncrime. The Congress should enact any legislation it can under the Constitution \nto provide for its elimination.\nAMERICAN INDIAN\nThe condition of the American Indian has much improved in recent years. Full \ncitizenship was bestowed upon them on June 2, 1924, and appropriations for their \ncare and advancement have been increased. Still there remains much to be done.\nNotable increases in appropriations for the several major functions performed \nby the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Indians have marked the last \nfive years. In that time, successive annual increases in appropriations for \ntheir education total $1,804,325; for medical care, $578,000; and for industrial \nadvancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more than would have been spent in the \nsame period on the basis of appropriations for 1923 and the preceding years.\nThe needs along health, educational, industrial and social lines however, are \ngreat, and the Budget estimates for 1929 include still further increases for \nIndian administration.\nTo advance the time when the Indians may become self-sustaining, it is my belief \nthat the Federal Government should continue to improve the facilities for their \ncare, and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the States.\nCOAL\nLegislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment \nby the President of a Board of Mediation and Conciliation in case of actual \nor threatened interruption of production is needed. The miners themselves are \nnow seeking information and action from the Government, which could readily \nbe secured through such a board. It is believed that a thorough investigation \nand reconsideration of this proposed policy by the Congress will demonstrate \nthat this recommendation is sound and should be adopted.\nPETROLEUM CONSERVATION\nThe National Government is undertaking to join in the formation of a cooperative \ncommittee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, to consider what legislation \nby the States or by the Congress can be adopted for the preservation and conservation \nof our supply of petroleum. This has come to be one of the main dependencies \nfor transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and industrial \nlife. It is expected the report of this committee will be available for later \ncongressional action. Meantime, the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior \nshould make certain leases of land belonging to the Osage Indians, in accordance \nwith the act of March 3, 1921, should be repealed. The authority to lease should \nbe discretionary, in order that the property of the Indians way not be wasted \nand the public suffer a future lack of supply.\nALIEN PROPERTY\nUnder treaty the property held by the Alien Property Custodian was to be retained \nuntil suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of American claims. \nWhile still protecting the American claimants, in order to afford every possible \naccommodation to the nationals of the countries whose property was held, the \nCongress has made liberal provision for the return of a larger part of the property. \nAll trusts under $10,000 were returned in full, and partial returns were made \non the others. The total returned was approximately $350,000,000.\nThere is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. The Mixed Claims Commission \nhas made such progress in the adjudication of claims that legislation can now \nbe enacted providing for the return of the property, which should be done under \nconditions which will protect our Government and our claimants. Such a measure \nwill be proposed, and I recommend its enactment.\nRAILROAD CONSOLIDATION\nIn order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost \nto the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. Legislation is needed \nto simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and arrangements \nfor consolidation, always under the control and with the approval of the Interstate \nCommerce Commission. Pending this, no adequate or permanent reorganization can \nbe made of the freight-rate structure. Meantime, both agriculture and industry \nare compelled to wait for needed relief. This is purely a business question, \nwhich should be stripped of all local and partisan bias and decided on broad \nprinciples and its merits in order to promote the public welfare. A large amount \nof new construction and equipment, which will furnish employment for labor and \nmarkets for commodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of this \nimportant question. Delay is holding back the progress of our country.\nMany of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the Washington \ntraction companies.\nVETERANS\nThe care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all men. \nThe yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about the cost \nof running the Federal Government, outside of the Post Office Department, before \nthe World War. The Congress will have before it recommendations of the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other like organizations, which should \nreceive candid consideration. We should continue to foster our system of compensation \nand rehabilitation, and provide hospitals and insurance. The magnitude \nof the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for further \nexpenditure should have the most searching scrutiny. Our present system of pensions \nis already sufficiently liberal. It was increased by the last Congress for Civil \nand Spanish War veterans and widows and for some dependents.\nIt has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing with \nveterans' relief be consolidated. This would bring many advantages. It is recommended \nthat the proper committees of the Congress make a thorough survey of this subject, \nin order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation is desirable.\nEDUCATION\nFor many years it has been the policy of the Federal Government to encourage \nand foster the cause of education. Large sums of money are annually appropriated \nto carry on vocational training. Many millions go into agricultural schools. \nThe general subject is under the immediate direction of a Commissioner of Education. \nWhile this subject is strictly a State and local function, it should continue \nto have the encouragement of the National Government. I am still of the opinion \nthat much good could be accomplished through the establishment of a Department \nof Education and Relief, into which would be gathered all of these functions \nunder one directing member of the Cabinet.\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOR\nIndustrial relations have never been more peaceful. In recent months they have \nsuffered from only one serious controversy. In all others difficulties have \nbeen adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settle controversies by \nfriendly agreement rather than by compulsion. The welfare of women and children \nis being especially guarded by our Department of Labor. Its Children's Bureau \nis in cooperation with 26 State boards and 80 juvenile courts.\nThrough its Bureau of Immigration it bas been found that medical examination \nabroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship. Some further legislation \nto provide for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in \nthis country, and granting more freedom for the migration of the North American \nIndian tribes is desirable.\nThe United States Employment Service has enabled about 2,000,000 men and women \nto gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. Particular attention has been \ngiven to assisting men past middle life and in providing field labor for harvesting \nagricultural crops. This has been made possible in part through the service \nof the Federal Board for Vocational Education, which is cooperating with the \nStates in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the wage \nearner.\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\nConstruction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for carrying \nout a public-building program for Washington. We have reached a time when not \nonly the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the public buildings of \nthe Capital City should be given much attention. It will be necessary to purchase \nfurther land and provide the required continuing appropriations.\nHISTORICAL CELEBRATIONS\nProvision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary \nof the birth of George Washington. Suggestion has been made for the construction \nof a memorial road leading from the Capital to Mount Vernon, which may well \nhave the consideration of the Congress, and the commission intrusted with preparations \nfor the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete writings \nof Washington and a series of writings by different authors relating to him.\nFebruary 25, 1929. is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the \ncapture of Fort Sackville, at Vincennes, in the State of Indiana. This \neventually brought into the Union what was known as the Northwest Territory, \nembracing the region north of the Ohio River between the Alleghenies and the \nMississippi River. This expedition was led by George Rogers Clark. His heroic \ncharacter and the importance of his victory are too little known and understood. \nThey gave us not only this Northwest Territory but by means of that the prospect \nof reaching the Pacific. The State of Indiana is proposing to dedicate the site \nof Fort Sackville as a national shrine. The Federal Government may well make \nsome provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial \nat that point.\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\nIt is the policy of the United States to promote peace. We are a peaceful people \nand committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment rather than \nby force. We have believed that peace can best be secured by a faithful observance \non our part of the principles of international law, accompanied by patience \nand conciliation, and requiring of others a like treatment for ourselves. We \nhave lately had some difference with Mexico relative to the injuries inflicted \nupon our nationals and their property within that country. A firm adherence \nto our rights and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of Mexico, both in \naccordance with the law of nations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it \nis hoped will resolve all our differences without interfering with the friendly \nrelationship between the two Governments.\nWe have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to China to protect \nthe lives and property of our citizens. Fortunately their simple presence there \nhas been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. But there has been \nconsiderable loss of property. That unhappy country is torn by factions and \nrevolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period. Meanwhile we are \nprotecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with any government which \nmay emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of China. They have always \nhad our friendship, and they should especially merit our consideration in these \ndays of their distraction and distress.\nWe were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in Nicaragua. Our \nmarine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and prevented \na heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion \nto a state of revolution. Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary of War, was sent \nthere to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers in effecting a \nsettlement between the contending parties. This was done on the assurance that \nwe would cooperate in restoring a state of peace where our rights would be protected \nby giving our assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election, which \noccurs in a few months. With this assurance the population returned to their \npeacetime pursuits, with the exception of some small roving bands of outlaws.\nIn general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improved \nwithin the year. While having a due regard for our own affairs, the protection \nof our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we can afford to be \nliberal toward others. Our example has become of great importance in the world. \nIt is recognized that we are independent, detached, and can and do take a disinterested \nposition in relation to international affairs. Our charity embraces the earth. \nOur trade is far flung. Our financial favors are widespread. Those who are peaceful \nand law-abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, but \nthat they can rely on our moral support. Proposals for promoting the peace of \nthe world will have careful consideration. But we are not a people who are always \nseeking for a sign. We know that peace comes from honesty and fair dealing, \nfrom moderation, and a generous regard for the rights of others. The heart of \nthe Nation is more important than treaties. A spirit of generous consideration \nis a more certain defense than great armaments. We should continue to promote \npeace by our example, and fortify it by such international covenants against \nwar as we are permitted under our Constitution to make.\nAMERICAN PROGRESS\nOur country has made much progress. But it has taken, and will continue to \ntake, much effort. Competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishness and \narrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weaker peoples \nwill be many. All of these are embraced in the opportunity for true greatness. \nThey will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity, and a spirit of neighborly \nkindness. The forces of the universe are taking humanity in that direction. \nIn doing good, in walking humbly, in sustaining its own people in ministering \nto other nations, America will work out its own mighty destiny."
