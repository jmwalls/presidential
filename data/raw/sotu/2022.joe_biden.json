  "text": "Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, and our First Lady and Second Gentleman, members of Congress and the Cabinet, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Americans: Last year, COVID-19 kept us apart. This year, we\u2019re finally together again.\nTonight \u2014 tonight we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, but, most importantly, as Americans with a duty to one another, to America, to the American people, and to the Constitution, and an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\nSix \u2014 thank you. Six days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\nAnd in this struggle \u2014 President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament, \u201cLight will win over darkness.\u201d\nThe Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the First Lady. Let each of us, if you\u2019re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world and Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nShe\u2019s bright, she\u2019s strong, and she\u2019s resolved.\nYes. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.\nThroughout our history, we\u2019ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving; and the costs, the threats to the America \u2014 and America, to the world keeps rising.\nThat\u2019s why the NATO Alliance was created: to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War Two.\nThe United States is a member, along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\nPutin\u2019s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn\u2019t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well.\nBut Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that\u2019s what we did: We stayed united.\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas to \u2014 from America to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin.\nLike many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European Allies.\nWe shared with the world, in advance, what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely and justify his aggression.\nWe countered Russia\u2019s lies with the truth. And now \u2014 now that he\u2019s acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with 27 members of the European Union \u2014 including France, Germany, Italy \u2014 as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others. Even Switzerland are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine.\nPutin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.\nTogether. Together. Together, along with our Allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We\u2019re cutting off Russia\u2019s largest banks from the international financial system; preventing Russia\u2019s Central Bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin\u2019s $630 billion war fund worthless. We\u2019re choking Russia\u2019s access, we\u2019re choking Russia\u2019s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\nTonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who\u2019ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more.\nThe United States \u2014 I mean it. The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.\nWe\u2019re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We\u2019re coming for your ill-begotten gains.\nAnd, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that we will join our Allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.\nHe has no idea what\u2019s coming.\nThe ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value, the Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended.\nThe Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.\nTogether with our Allies, we\u2019re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom: military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We\u2019re giving more than a billion dollars in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we\u2019ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.\nBut let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\nFor that purpose, we have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries, including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\nAnd as I\u2019ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power \u2014 every single inch.\nAnd we\u2019re clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks, and months will be hard on them.\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\nAnd a pound of Ukrainian people \u2014 the proud, proud people \u2014 pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of (inaudible) they have. They\u2019ve known 30 years of independence \u2014 have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\nTo all Americans, I\u2019ll be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator infa- \u2014 invading a foreign country has costs around the world. And I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy and that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\nTonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels of our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our Allies.\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. But I know news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming to all Americans. But I want you to know: We\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019re going to be okay.\nWhen the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\nWhile it shouldn\u2019t and while it shouldn\u2019t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what\u2019s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West.\nWe see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\nThis is the real test, and it\u2019s going to take time. So, let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations: We stand with you. We stand with you.\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he\u2019ll never gain the hearts and souls of Ukrainian people. He\u2019ll never \u2014 he\u2019ll never extinguish their love of freedom. And he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\nI understand, like many of you did. My dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family; it had an impact.\nThat\u2019s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan, because people were hurting. We needed to act and we did.\nFew pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of a crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk? It cut the cost of healthcare insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave the people \u201cjust a little bit of breathing room.\u201d\nAnd unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people and left no one behind. And, folks \u2014 and it worked. It worked.\nIt worked and created jobs \u2014 lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America.\nThe economy grew at a rate of 5.7 last year \u2014 the strongest growth rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn\u2019t worked for working people in this nation for too long.\nFor the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would \u2014 would benefit.\nBut that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in the \u2014 in nearly a century.\nLook, Vice President Harris and I ran for office \u2014 and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this \u2014 but ran for office with a new economic vision for America: invest in America; educate Americans; grow the workforce; build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows \u2014 when the middle class grows, the poor go way up and the wealthy do very well.\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. And now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won\u2019t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st century if we don\u2019t fix it.\nThat\u2019s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And I thank my Republican friends who joined to invest and rebuild America \u2014 the single biggest investment in history.\nIt was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We\u2019re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We\u2019re now talking about an infrastructure decade.\nAnd look, it\u2019s going to \u2014 it\u2019s going to transform America to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world, particularly China.\nI\u2019ve told Xi Jinping: It\u2019s never been a good bet to bet against the American people.\nWe\u2019ll create good jobs for millions of Americans \u2014 modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways \u2014 all across America. And we\u2019ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\nWe\u2019ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes, so every child, every American has clean water to drink at home and at school.\nWe\u2019re going to provide \u2014 provide affordable high-speed Internet for every American \u2014 rural, suburban, urban, and Tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.\nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing that, this year, we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\nAnd, folks, when we use taxpayers\u2019 dollars to rebuild America, we\u2019re going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs.\nThe federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep this country safe and secure. There\u2019s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers\u2019 dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration \u2014 Democrat and Republican \u2014 says they\u2019ll do it, but we\u2019re actually doing it.\nWe\u2019ll buy America to make sure every \u2014 everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.\nBut, folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to pass the bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\nWe used to invest almost 2 percent of our GDP in research and development. We don\u2019t now. Can\u2019t \u2014 China is.\nLet me give you one example why it\u2019s so important to pass.\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you\u2019ll find a thousand empty acres of land. It won\u2019t look like much. But if you stop and look closely, you\u2019ll see a \u201cfield of dreams\u201d \u2014 the ground on which America\u2019s future will be built.\nThat\u2019s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor \u201cmega site.\u201d Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten thousand new jobs. And in those factories, the average job \u2014 about $135 \u2014 $135,000 a year.\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology that \u2014 the Internet \u2014 technology that\u2019s yet to be invented.\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning.\nIntel\u2019s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight \u2014 and I don\u2019t know where Pat is. Pat? There you go, Pat. Stand up. Pat came to see me, and he told me they\u2019re ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.\nThat would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they\u2019re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\nSo, let\u2019s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk, I\u2019ll sign it, and we will really take off in a big way.\nAnd, folks, Intel is not alone. There\u2019s something happening in America. Just look around, and you\u2019ll see an amazing story \u2014 the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products \u201cMade in America,\u201d the revitalization of American manufacturing.\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas. That\u2019s what is happening.\nFord is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\nGM is making the largest investment in its history \u2014 $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\nAll told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone.\nFolks, powered by people I\u2019ve met \u2014 like JoJo Burgess from generations of union steelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight. Where are you, JoJo? There you go. Thanks, buddy.\nAs Ohio \u2014 as Ohio Sherrod Brown says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u2018Rust Belt.'\u201d It\u2019s time to see the \u2014 the \u2014 what used to be called the Rust Belt become the \u2014 the home of a significant resurgence of manufacturing.\nAnd with all the bright spots in our economy \u2014 record job growth, higher wages \u2014 too many families are struggling to keep up with their bills.\nInflation is robbing them of gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel.\nI get it. That\u2019s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\nI get it. That\u2019s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\nLook, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. So, you didn\u2019t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out \u2014 the factory was closed.\nThe pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens, it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and go \u2014 prices go up.\nLook at cars last year. One third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren\u2019t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\nAnd guess what? Prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well.\nAnd so, we have a choice.\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\nI think I have a better idea to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages.\nAnd, folks, that means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\nInstead of relying on foreign supply chains, let\u2019s make it in America.\nLook, economists call this increasing the productive capacity of our economy.\nI call it building a better America.\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and, I believe, most Americans support the plan.\nAnd here\u2019s the plan.\nFirst, cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world.\nJust look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy \u2014 the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis. He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day.\nInsulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That\u2019s what it costs the \u2014 the pharmaceutical company. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times that amount.\nI spoke with Joshua\u2019s mom. Imagine what it\u2019s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God\u2019s name you\u2019re going to be able to pay for it \u2014 what it does to your family, but what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it. Think about that. That\u2019s what I think about.\nYou know, yesterday \u2014 Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\nFor Joshua and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. And drug companies will do very, very well \u2014 their profit margin.\nAnd while we\u2019re at it \u2014 I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this \u2014 let\u2019s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans to save them $2,400 a year on their health premiums. Let\u2019s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\nAnd second, let\u2019s cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\nLet\u2019s provide an investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and your business to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America\u2019s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you\u2019ve not going to have to pay at the pump.\nFolks \u2014 third \u2014 the third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of childcare. Cut the cost of childcare.\nFolks, if you live in a major city in America, you can pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare per child.\nI was a single dad for five years, raising two kids. I had a lot of help, though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother, and sister that really helped.\nBut middle-class and working folks shouldn\u2019t have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for their young children.\nMy plan would cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\u2019t afford childcare to be able to get back to work, generating economic growth.\nBut my plan doesn\u2019t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care, more affordable housing, pre-K for three- and four-year-olds. All of these will lower costs to families.\nAnd under my plan, nobody \u2014 let me say this again \u2014 nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.\nI may be wrong, but my guess is, if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we\u2019d all agree that the present tax system ain\u2019t fair. We have to fix it.\nI\u2019m not looking to punish anybody, but let\u2019s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share.\nLook, last year \u2014 like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman \u2014 we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in America combined. And I still won 36 years in a row. The point is: Even they understand they should pay just a fair share.\nLast year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes.\nNo, look, it\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s why I proposed a 15 percent minimum tax rate for corporations.\nWe\u2019ve got \u2014 and that\u2019s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we were able to put together \u2014 I was able to be somewhat helpful \u2014 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate \u2014 so companies can\u2019t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. It\u2019ll raise billions of dollars.\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed closing loopholes for the very wealthy who don\u2019t pay \u2014 who pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.\nSo that\u2019s my plan. But we have \u2014 we\u2019ll go into more detail later.\nI\u2019m going to grow \u2014 we will grow the economy, lower the costs to families.\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s get this done. We all know we\u2019ve got to make changes.\nFolks, and while you\u2019re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\nMy plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\nThe previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs \u2014 the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see, every day, how much money was being spent, where it \u2014 was it going to the right place?\nIn my administration, the watchdogs are back. And we\u2019re going after the criminals who stole billions of relief money meant for small business and millions of Americans.\nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\nAnd, look I think we all agree \u2014 thank you \u2014 by the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office \u2014 the only President ever to cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion in a single year.\nLowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I\u2019m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up prices.\nWhen corporations have to compete, their profits go up and your prices go up \u2014 when they don\u2019t have to compete.\nSmall businesses and family farmers and ranchers \u2014 I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states \u2014 guess what? You got four basic meatpacking facilities. That\u2019s it. You play with them or you don\u2019t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more \u2014 a hell of a lot more because there\u2019s only four.\nSee what\u2019s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits.\nTonight, I\u2019m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\nFolks and as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will look at that closely.\nWe\u2019re also going to cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot; provide more training and apprenticeships; hire them based on skills, not just their degrees.\nLet\u2019s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; and extend the Child Tax Credit so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\nLet\u2019s increase Pell Grants; increase our historic support for HBCUs; and invest in what Jill, our First Lady, who teaches full-time, calls America\u2019s best-kept secret: community colleges.\nLook, let\u2019s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union, they shouldn\u2019t be able to be stopped.\nWhen we invest in our workers and we build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, together we can do something we haven\u2019t done in a long time: build a better America.\nFor more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of this nation. And I know you\u2019re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. That doesn\u2019t even count the close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.\nBut I also know this: Because of the progress we\u2019ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we\u2019re moving forward safely, back to a norm- \u2014 more normal routines.\nWe\u2019ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19 where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.\nJust a few days ago, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guidelines. Under the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free.\nAnd based on projections \u2014 and based on projections, more of the country will reach a point across \u2014 that point across the next couple of weeks.\nAnd thanks to the progress we\u2019ve made in the past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives. I know some are talking about \u201cliving with COVID-19.\u201d But tonight, I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19; we\u2019ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.\nAnd because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard. And here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely, in my view:\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you\u2019re vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection, and we\u2019ll never give up on vaccinating more Americans.\nNow, I know parents with kids under five are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children. Scientists are working hard to get that done, and we\u2019ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.\nWe\u2019re already \u2014 we are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent.\nI\u2019ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month.\nAnd now we\u2019re launching the \u201cTest to Treat\u201d initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove positive, receive the antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\nAnd folks if you\u2019re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\nWe\u2019re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs as we move forward.\nOn testing, we\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\nAnd we\u2019ve already ordered free tests. If you already ordered free tests, tonight I\u2019m announcing you can order another group of tests. COVID \u2014 go to COVIDTests.gov, starting next week, and you can get more tests.\nSecond, we must prepare for new variants.\nOver the past \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we\u2019ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years. And if Congress provides the funds we need, we\u2019ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed.\nI can\u2019t promise a new variant won\u2019t come, but I ca- \u2014 I can promise you we\u2019ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\nIt\u2019s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.\nWe\u2019re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\nOur schools are open. Let\u2019s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\nWith 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. Of course, continuing this costs money, so it will not surprise you I\u2019ll be back to see you all. And re- \u2014 I\u2019m going to soon send a request to Congress.\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again \u2014 we may need them again. So I expect Congress \u2014 and I hope you\u2019ll pass that quickly.\nFourth, we\u2019ll continue vaccinating the world. We\u2019ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries \u2014 more than any nation on Earth. We won\u2019t stop, because you can\u2019t build a wall high enough to keep out a \u2014\nA vaccine \u2014 the vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.\nYou know, we\u2019ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. The worst of all, the much loss of life.\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. So, stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: a God-awful disease.\nLet\u2019s stop sending \u2014 seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we are: fellow Americans.\nLook we can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. That was a long time in coming. But we can change how to move forward on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.\nI recently visited New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\nThey were responding to a 911 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old. Both Dominican Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.\nI spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices and we\u2019ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety in every community it deserves.\nLike some of you that have been around for a while \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community policing \u2014 cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\nLet\u2019s not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice. Let\u2019s come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\nThat\u2019s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\nThat\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.\nWe should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.\nIt\u2019s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training \u2014 resources and training they need to protect our communities.\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\nAnd we\u2019ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home \u2014 no serial numbers, can\u2019t be traced.\nI ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?\nAnd, folks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\nLook, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\u2019t be sued \u2014 the only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufactures.\nThese laws don\u2019t infringe on the Second Amendment; they save lives.\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote and have it counted. And look, it\u2019s under assault.\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed not only to suppress the vote \u2014 we\u2019ve been there before \u2014 but to subvert the entire election. We can\u2019t let this happen.\nTonight, I call on the Senate to pass \u2014 pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Act \u2014 Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know who is funding our elections.\nLook, tonight, I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Breyer \u2014 an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\nJustice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean it. Get up. Stand \u2014 let me see you. Thank you.\nAnd we all know \u2014 no matter what your ideology, we all know one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\nAs I did four days ago, I\u2019ve nominated a Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds who will continue in just Brey- \u2014 Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender from a family of public-school educators and police officers \u2014 she\u2019s a consensus builder.\nSince she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\nSince she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.\nAnd as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling.\nWe\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\nWe\u2019re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases \u2014 cases heard faster \u2014 and those who aren\u2019t legitimately here can be sent back.\nWe\u2019re screening \u2014 we\u2019re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led the generation of immigrants to this land \u2014 my forebearers and many of yours.\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers \u2014 those with temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. To revise our laws so businesses have workers they need and families don\u2019t wait decades to reunite.\nIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s economically smart thing to do. That\u2019s why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let\u2019s get it done once and for all.\nFolks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. The constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade, standing precedent for half a century, is under attack as never before.\nIf you want to go forward not backwards, we must protect access to healthcare; preserve a woman\u2019s right to choose \u2014 and continue to advance maternal healthcare for all Americans.\nAnd folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\u2019s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families \u2014 it\u2019s simply wrong.\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I\u2019ll always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\nFolks as I\u2019ve just demonstrated, while it often appears we do not agree and that \u2014 we \u2014 we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge.\nI signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year, from preventing government shutdowns, to protecting Asian Americans from still-too-common hate crimes, to reforming military justice. And we\u2019ll soon be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago.\nAnd it\u2019s important \u2014 it\u2019s important for us to show \u2014 to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\nSo tonight, I\u2019m offering a \u201cUnity Agenda for the Nation\u201d: four big things we can do together, in my view.\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. There\u2019s so much we can do: increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery; get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors and \u2014 that stop doctors from prescribing treatments; stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after the traffickers.\nAnd if you\u2019re suffering from addiction, you know \u2014 you should know you\u2019re not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million \u2014 23 million Americans in recovery.\nSecond, let\u2019s take on mental health \u2014 especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school \u2014 your school does just that. They have the money.\nWe can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic: bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\u2019re conducting on our children for profit. Folks \u2014 thank you. Thank you for the courage you showed.\nIt\u2019s time to strengthen privacy protections; ban targeted advertising to children; demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\nAnd let\u2019s get all Americans the mental health services they need \u2014 more people can turn for help and full parity between physical and mental healthcare if we treat it that way in our insurance.\nLook, the third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They\u2019re the best of us.\nI\u2019ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip those we send to war and care for those and their family when they come home.\nMy administration is providing assistance and job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt free.\nAnd our troops in Iraq have faced \u2014 and Afghanistan \u2014 have faced many dangers. One being stationed at bases, breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits. Many of you have been there. I\u2019ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste \u2014 the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more.\nAnd they come home \u2014 many of the world\u2019s fittest and best trained warriors in the world \u2014 never the same: headaches, numbness, dizziness, a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know.\nOne of those \u2014 one of those soldiers was my son, Major Beau Biden. I don\u2019t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near \u2014 that his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier than that, in Kosovo is the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many other troops. But I\u2019m committed to find out everything we can.\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio, the widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\nDanielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter. But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath\u2019s lungs and body.\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. He didn\u2019t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\nThrough her pain, she found purpose to demand that we do better. Tonight, Danielle, we are going to do better.\nThe VA \u2014 the VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits. And tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\nI\u2019m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive healthcare they deserve.\nAnd fourth and last, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it. This is personal. This is personal to me and to Jill and to Kamala and so many of you. So many of you have lost someone you love \u2014 husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.\nCancer is the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease.\nLast month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\nOur goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. And I think we can do better than that: turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases, more support for patients and families.\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund what I called ARPA-H: Advanced \u2014 Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department, projects that led \u2014 in DARPA \u2014 to the Internet, GPS, and so much more that make our forces more safer and be able to wage war more \u2014 with more clarity.\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and diabetes, and more.\nA Unity Agenda for the nation. We can do these things. It\u2019s within our power. And I don\u2019t see a partisan edge to any one of those four things.\nMy fellow Americans \u2014 tonight we\u2019ve gathered in a sacred space: the citadel of democracy. In this Capitol, generation after generation of Americans have debated great questions amid great strife and have done great things.\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. We built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\nNow is the hour: our moment of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history itself. It is in this moment that our character of this generation is formed, our purpose is found, our future is forged.\nWell, I know this nation. We\u2019ll meet the test, protect freedom and liberty, expand fairness and opportunity. And we will save democracy.\nAs hard as those times have been, I\u2019m more optimistic about America today than I\u2019ve been my whole life because I see the future that\u2019s within our grasp, because I know there is simply nothing beyond our camas- \u2014 our capacity.\nWe\u2019re the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we\u2019ve faced into an opportunity, the only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\nSo, on this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I\u2019ve come to report on the state of the nation \u2014 the state of the union. And my report is this: The State of the Union is strong because you, the American people, are strong.\nWe are stronger today \u2014 we are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we\u2019ll be stronger a year from now than we are today.\nThis is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. And we will, as one people, one America \u2014 the United States of America.\nGod bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Go get \u2019em."
