  "text": "GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\nThe year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my constitutional \nduty to give to the Congress from time to time information on the state of the \nUnion has been so crowded with great events, great processes, and great results \nthat I cannot hope to give you an adequate picture of its transactions or of \nthe far-reaching changes which have been wrought of our nation and of the world. \nYou have yourselves witnessed these things, as I have. it is too soon to assess \nthem; and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified \nthan men of another generation will be to say what they mean, or even what they \nhave been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute, \nin a sense, part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To \nstate them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which \nmust grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine.\nA year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, \nan average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising, in May last, to \n245,951, in June to 278,76o, in July to 307,182, and continuing to reach similar \nfigures in August and September,in August 289,57o and in September 257,438. \nNo such movement of troops ever took place before, across three thousand miles \nof sea, followed by adequate equipment and supplies, and carried safely through \nextraordinary dangers of attack,-dangers which were alike strange and infinitely \ndifficult to guard against. In all this movement only seven hundred and fifty-eight \nmen were lost by enemy attack,six hundred and thirty of whom were upon a single \nEnglish transport which was sunk near the Orkney Islands.\nI need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and material. \nIt is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting organization of \nthe industries of the country and of all its productive activities more complete, \nmore thorough in method and effective in result, more spirited and unanimous \nin purpose and effort than any other great belligerent had been able to effect. \nWe profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been \nengaged for nearly three years in the exigent and exacting business, their every \nresource and every executive proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were their \npupils. But we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of \ncooperation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the world \nwith unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.\nBut it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, \nsupply, equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality \nof the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas, and \nthe spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers or sailors ever \nproved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves \nwith more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us \nwho played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed \nirresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight \nour thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their officers understood the \ngrim and exacting task they had undertaken and performed it with an audacity, \nefficiency, and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle \nwith imperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great \nor small, -from their great chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to the youngest \nlieutenant; and their men were worthy of them,-such men as hardly need to be \ncommanded, and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence \nof those who know just what it is they would accomplish. I am proud to be the \nfellowcountryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those of us who stayed at home \ndid our duty; the war could not have been won or the gallant men who fought \nit given their opportunity to win it otherwise; but for many a long day we shall \nthink ourselves \"accurs'd we were not there, and hold our manhoods cheap while \nany speaks that fought\" with these at St. Mihiel or Thierry. The memory of those \ndays of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves; \nand each will have his favorite memory. \"Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, \nbut hell remember with advantages what feats he did that day!\"\nWhat we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in force \ninto the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole fate of the \nworld seemed to hang in the balance and threw their fresh strength into the \nranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle,-turn \nit once for all, so that thenceforth it was back, back, back for their enemies, \nalways back, never again forward! After that it was only a scant four months \nbefore the commanders of the Central Empires knew themselves beaten; and now \ntheir very empires are in liquidation!\nAnd throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation was: what unity of \npurpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through all its splendid \ndisplay of strength, its untiring accomplishment! I have said that those of \nus who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply will always \nwish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our labor; but we can \nnever be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of \nfine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and devoted \nthe whole of their trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of \nthe whole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing \ndevotion and distinguished capacity that marked their toilsome labors, day after \nday, month after month, have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in \nthe trenches and on the sea. And not the men here in Washington only. They have \nbut directed the vast achievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable \nfarms, in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines, wherever \nthe stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the shipyards, on \nthe railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every labor that was needed to sustain \nthe battle lines, men have vied with each other to do their part and do it well. \nThey can look any man-at-arms in the face, and say, We also strove to win and \ngave the best that was in us to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph!\nAnd what shall we say of the women,-of their instant intelligence, quickening \nevery task that they touched; their capacity for organization and cooperation, \nwhich gave their action discipline and enhanced the effectiveness of everything \nthey attempted; their aptitude at tasks to which they had. never before set \ntheir hands; their utter selfsacrifice alike in what they did and in what they \ngave? Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have \nadded a new lustre to the annals of American womanhood.\nThe least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in political \nrights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field of practical \nwork they have entered, whether for themselves or for their country. These great \ndays of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act \nof justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered the women \nof the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which \nour people have voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the \nworld and the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we \nhad that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never \nbe fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can \nsay that we are the kinsmen of such.\nAnd now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was made. \nIt has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and inspiration of \nthese days of achievement quick within us, we turn to the tasks of peace again,-a \npeace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarchs and ambitious military \ncoteries and made ready for a new order, for new foundations of justice and \nfair dealing.\nWe are about to give order and organization to this peace not only for ourselves \nbut for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as they will suffer us \nto serve them. It is international justice that we seek, not domestic safety \nmerely. Our thoughts have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon Asia, upon the near \nand the far East, very little upon the acts of peace and accommodation that \nwait to be performed at our own doors. While we are adjusting our relations \nwith the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear \naway all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof \nof the friendship we really feel? I hope that the members of the Senate will \npermit me to speak once more of the unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment \nwith the Republic of Colombia. I very earnestly urge upon them an early and \nfavorable action upon that vital matter. I believe that they will feel, with \nme, that the stage of affairs is now set for such action as will be not only \njust but generous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily \nentered.\nSo far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to \npeace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That problem is \nless serious for us than it may turn out too he for the nations which have suffered \nthe disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we. Our people, moreover, \ndo not wait to be coached and led. They know their own business, are quick and \nresourceful at every readjustment, definite in purpose, and self-reliant in \naction. Any leading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become \nhopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go their \nown way. All that we can do as their legislative and executive servants is to \nmediate the process of change here, there, and elsewhere as we may. I have heard \nmuch counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted \nto a happy consummation, but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme \nof \"reconstruction\" emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited \nbusiness men and self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience.\nWhile the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries \nof the country in the services it was necessary for them to render, by which \nto make sure of an abundant supply of the materials needed, by which to check \nundertakings that could for the time be dispensed with and stimulate those that \nwere most serviceable in war, by which to gain for the purchasing departments \nof the Government a certain control over the prices of essential articles and \nmaterials, by which to restrain trade with alien enemies, make the most of the \navailable shipping, and systematize financial transactions, both public and \nprivate, so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion,-by which, \nin short, to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw -the \ncommon load and make of us one team in the accomplishment of a great task. But \nthe moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off. \nRaw materials upon which the Government had kept its hand for fear there should \nnot be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been released \nand put into the general market again. Great industrial plants whose whole output \nand machinery had been taken over for the uses of the Government have been set \nfree to return to the uses to which they were put before the war. It has not \nbeen possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and \nof shipping, because the world has still to be fed from our granaries and the \nships are still needed to send supplies to our men overseas and to bring the \nmen back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side of the water \npermit; but even there restraints are being relaxed as much as possible and \nmore and more as the weeks go by\nNever before have there been agencies in existence in this country which knew \nso much of the field of supply, of labor, and of industry as the War Industries \nBoard, the War Trade Board, the Labor Department, the Food Administration, and \nthe Fuel Administration have known since their labors became thoroughly systematized; \nand they have not been isolated agencies; they have been directed by men who \nrepresented the permanent Departments of the Government and so have been the \ncentres of unified and cooperative action. It has been the policy of the Executive, \ntherefore, since the armistice was assured (which is in effect a complete submission \nof the enemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the business \nmen of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and \nin every matter where it was desired. It is surprising how fast the process \nof return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting \nstopped. It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid \nthat may be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will \ndirect itself. The American business man is of quick initiative.\nThe ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not, however, \nprovide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning armies. Those \nwho are of trained capacity, those who are skilled workmen, those who have acquired \nfamiliarity with established businesses, those who are ready and willing to \ngo to the farms, all those whose aptitudes are known or will be sought out by \nemployers will find no difficulty, it is safe to say, in finding place and employment. \nBut there will be others who will be at a loss where to gain a livelihood unless \npains are taken to guide them and put them in the way of work. There will be \na large floating residuum of labor which should not be left wholly to shift \nfor itself. It seems to me important, therefore, that the development of public \nworks of every sort should be promptly resumed, in order that opportunities \nshould be created for unskilled labor in particular, and that plans should be \nmade for such developments of our unused lands and our natural resources as \nwe have hitherto lacked stirnulation to undertake.\nI particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the \nSecretary of the Interior has developed in his annual report and before your \nCommittees for the reclamation of arid, swamp, and cutover lands which might, \nif the States were willing and able to cooperate, redeem some three hundred \nmillion acres of land for cultivation. There are said to be fifteen or twenty \nmillion acres of land in the West, at present arid, for whose reclamation water \nis available, if properly conserved. There are about two hundred and thirty \nmillion acres from which the forests have been cut but which have never yet \nbeen cleared for the plow and which lie waste and desolate. These lie scattered \nall over the Union. And there are nearly eighty million acres of land that lie \nunder swamps or subject to periodical overflow or too wet for anything but grazing, \nwhich it is perfectly feasible to drain and protect and redeem. The Congress \ncan at once direct thousands of the returning soldiers to the reclamation of \nthe arid lands which it has already undertaken, if it will but enlarge the plans \nand appropriations which it has entrusted to the Department of the Interior. \nIt is possible in dealing with our unused land to effect a great rural and agricultural \ndevelopment which will afford the best sort of opportunity to men who want to \nhelp themselves' and the Secretary of the Interior has thought the possible \nmethods out in a way which is worthy of your most friendly attention.\nI have spoken of the control which must yet for a while, perhaps for a long \nlong while, be exercised over shipping because of the priority of service to \nwhich our forces overseas are entitled and which should also be accorded the \nshipments which are to save recently liberated peoples from starvation and many \ndevasted regions from permanent ruin. May I not say a special word about the \nneeds of Belgium and northern France? No sums of money paid by way of indemnity \nwill serve of themselves to save them from hopeless disadvantage for years to \ncome. Something more must be done than merely find the money. If they had money \nand raw materials in abundance to-morrow they could not resume their place in \nthe industry of the world to-morrow,-the very important place they held before \nthe flame of war swept across them. Many of their factories are razed to the \nground. Much of their machinery is destroyed or has been taken away. Their people \nare scattered and many of their best workmen are dead. Their markets will be \ntaken by others, if they are not in some special way assisted to rebuild their \nfactories and replace their lost instruments of manufacture. They should not \nbe left to the vicissitudes of the sharp competition for materials and for industrial \nfacilities which is now to set in. I hope, therefore, that the Congress will \nnot be unwilling, if it should become necessary, to grant to some such agency \nas the War Trade Board the right to establish priorities of export and supply \nfor the benefit of these people whom we have been so happy to assist in saving \nfrom the German terror and whom we must not now thoughtlessly leave to shift \nfor themselves in a pitiless competitive market.\nFor the steadying, and facilitation of our own domestic business readjustments \nnothing is more important than the immediate determination of the taxes that \nare to be levied for 1918, 1919, and 1920. As much of the burden of taxation \nmust be lifted from business as sound methods of financing the Government will \npermit, and those who conduct the great essential industries of the country \nmust be told as exactly as possible what obligations to the Government they \nwill be expected to meet in the years immediately ahead of them. It will be \nof serious consequence to the country to delay removing all uncertainties in \nthis matter a single day longer than the right processes of debate justify. \nIt is idle to talk of successful and confident business reconstruction before \nthose uncertainties are resolved.\nIf the war had continued it would have been necessary to raise at least eight \nbillion dollars by taxation payable in the year 1919; but the war has ended \nand I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that it will be safe to reduce \nthe amount to six billions. An immediate rapid decline in the expenses of the \nGovernment is not to be looked for. Contracts made for war supplies will, indeed, \nbe rapidly cancelled and liquidated, but their immediate liquidation will make \nheavy drains on the Treasury for the months just ahead of us. The maintenance \nof our forces on the other side of the sea is still necessary. A considerable \nproportion of those forces must remain in Europe during the period of occupation, \nand those which are brought home will be transported and demobilized at heavy \nexpense for months to come. The interest on our war debt must of course be paid \nand provision made for the retirement of the obligations of the Government which \nrepresent it. But these demands will of course fall much below what a continuation \nof military operations would have entailed and six billions should suffice to \nsupply a sound foundation for the financial operations of the year.\nI entirely concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending that \nthe two billions needed in addition to the four billions provided by existing \nlaw be obtained from the profits which have accrued and shall accrue from war \ncontracts and distinctively war business, but that these taxes be confined to \nthe war profits accruing in 1918, or in 1919 from business originating in war \ncontracts. I urge your acceptance of his recommendation that provision be made \nnow, not subsequently, that the taxes to be paid in 192o should be reduced from \nsix to four billions. Any arrangements less definite than these would add elements \nof doubt and confusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through \nwhich the country must now immediately pass, and which no true friend of the \nnation's essential business interests can afford to be responsible for creating \nor prolonging. Clearly determined conditions, clearly and simply charted, are \nindispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial development which \nmay confidently be expected if we act now andsweep all interrogation points \naway.\nI take it for granted that the Congress will carry out the naval programme \nwhich was undertaken before we entered the war. The Secretary of the Navy has \nsubmitted to your Committees for authorization that part of the programme which \ncovers the building plans of the next three years. These plans have been prepared \nalong the lines and in accordance with the policy which the Congress established, \nnot under the exceptional conditions of the war, but with the intention of adhering \nto a definite method of development for the navy. I earnestly recommend the \nuninterrupted pursuit of that policy. It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt \nto adjust our programmes to a future world policy as yet undetermined.\nThe question which causes me the greatest concern is the question of the policy \nto be adopted towards the railroads. I frankly turn to you for counsel upon \nit. I have no confident judgment of my own. I do not see how any thoughtful \nman can have who knows anything of the complexity of the problem. It is a problem \nwhich must be studied, studied immediately, and studied without bias or prejudice. \nNothing can be gained by becoming partisans of any particular plan of settlement.\nIt was necessary that the administration of the railways should be taken over \nby the Government so long as the war lasted. It would have been impossible otherwise \nto establish and carry through under a single direction the necessary priorities \nof shipment. It would have been impossible otherwise to combine maximum production \nat the factories and mines and farms with the maximum possible car supply to \ntake the products to the ports and markets; impossible to route troop shipments \nand freight shipments without regard to the advantage or-disadvantage of the \nroads employed; impossible to subordinate, when necessary, all questions of \nconvenience to the public necessity; impossible to give the necessary financial \nsupport to the roads from the public treasury. But all these necessities have \nnow been served, and the question is, What is best for the railroads and for \nthe public in the future?\nExceptional circumstances and exceptional methods of administration were not \nneeded to convince us that the railroads were not equal to the immense tasks \nof transportation imposed upon them by the rapid and continuous development \nof the industries of the country. We knew that already. And we knew that they \nwere unequal to it partly because their full cooperation was rendered impossible \nby law and their competition made obligatory, so that it has been impossible \nto assign to them severally the traffic which could best be carried by their \nrespective lines in the interest of expedition and national economy.\nWe may hope, I believe, for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by \nthe time Spring has come. The twentyone months to which the present control \nof the railways is limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have been \nmade will run at the farthest, I take it for granted, only to the January of \n1921. The full equipment of the railways which the federal administration had \nplanned could not be completed within any such period. The present law does \nnot permit the use of the revenues of the several roads for the execution of \nsuch plans except by formal contract with their directors, some of whom will \nconsent while some will not, and therefore does not afford sufficient authority \nto undertake improvements upon the scale upon which it would be necessary to \nundertake them. Every approach to this difficult subject-matter of decision \nbrings us face to face, therefore, with this unanswered question: What is it \nright that we should do with the railroads, in the interest of the public and \nin fairness to their owners?\nLet me say at once that I have no answer ready. The only thing that is perfectly \nclear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the owners of \nthe railroads to leave the question unanswered and that it will presently become \nmy duty to relinquish control of the roads, even before the expiration of the \nstatutory period, unless there should appear some clear prospect in the meantime \nof a legislative solution. Their release would at least produce one element \nof a solution, namely certainty and a quick stimulation of private initiative.\nI believe that it will be serviceable for me to set forth as explicitly as \npossible the alternative courses that lie open to our choice. We can simply \nrelease the roads and go back to the old conditions of private management, unrestricted \ncompetition, and multiform regulation by both state and federal authorities; \nor we can go to the opposite extreme and establish complete government control, \naccompanied, if necessary, by actual government ownership; or we can adopt an \nintermediate course of modified private control, under a more unified and affirmative \npublic regulation and under such alterations of the law as will permit wasteful \ncompetition to be avoided and a considerable degree of unification of administration \nto be effected, as, for example, by regional corporations under which the railways \nof definable areas would be in effect combined in single systems.\nThe one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it would \nbe a disservice alike to the country and to the owners of the railroads to return \nto the old conditions unmodified. Those are conditions of restraint without \ndevelopment. There is nothing affirmative or helpful about them. What the country \nchiefly needs is that all its means of transportation should be developed, its \nrailways, its waterways, its highways, and its countryside roads. Some new element \nof policy, therefore, is absolutely necessary\u2014necessary for the service of \nthe public, necessary for the release of credit to those who are administering \nthe railways, necessary for the protection of their security holders. The old \npolicy may be changed much or little, but surely it cannot wisely be left as \nit was. I hope that the Con will have a complete and impartial study \nof the whole problem instituted at once and prosecuted as rapidly as possible. \nI stand ready and anxious to release the roads from the present control and \nI must do so at a very early date if by waiting until the statutory limit of \ntime is reached I shall be merely prolonging the period of doubt and uncertainty \nwhich is hurtful to every interest concerned.\nI welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in \nParis the representatives of the governments with which we have been associated \nin the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of discussing with them \nthe main features of the treaty of peace. I realize the great inconveniences \nthat will attend my leaving the country, particularly at this time, but the \nconclusion that it was my paramount duty to go has been forced upon me by considerations \nwhich I hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me.\nThe Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to \nthe Congress on the eighth of January last, as the Central Empires also have, \nand very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application, \nand it is highly desirable that I should give it in order that the sincere desire \nof our Government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements \nthat will be of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully \nmanifest. The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent \nimportance both to us and to the rest of the world, and I know of no business \nor interest which should take precedence of them. The gallant men of our armed \nforces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they knew \nto be the ideals of their country; I have sought to express those ideals; they \nhave accepted my statements of them as the substance of their own thought and \npurpose, as the associated governments have accepted them; I owe it to them \nto see to it, so far as in me lies, that no false or mistaken interpretation \nis put upon them, and no possible effort omitted to realize them. It is now \nmy duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life's blood \nto obtain. I can think of no call to service which could transcend this.\nI shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side the water, \nand you will know all that I do. At my request, the French and English governments \nhave absolutely removed the censorship of cable news which until within a fortnight \nthey had maintained and there is now no censorship whatever exercised at this \nend except upon attempted trade communications with enemy countries. It has \nbeen necessary to keep an open wire constantly available between Paris and the \nDepartment of State and another between France and the Department of War. In \norder that this might be done with the least possible interference with the \nother uses of the cables, I have temporarily taken over the control of both \ncables in order that they may be used as a single system. I did so at the advice \nof the most experienced cable officials, and I hope that the results will justify \nmy hope that the news of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom \nand with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other.\nMay I not hope, Gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I shall \nhave to perform on the other side of the sea, in my efforts truly and faithfully \nto interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love, I may have \nthe encouragement and the added strength of your united support? I realize the \nmagnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking; I am poignantly aware \nof its grave responsibilities. I am the servant of the nation. I can have no \nprivate thought or purpose of my own in performing such an errand. I go to give \nthe best that is in me to the common settlements which I must now assist in \narriving at in conference with the other working heads of the associated governments. \nI shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement. I shall not \nbe inaccessible. The cables and the wireless will render me available for any \ncounsel or service you may desire of me, and I shall be happy in the thought \nthat I am constantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with \nwhich we shall have to deal. I shall make my absence as brief as possible and \nshall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to translate \ninto action the great ideals for which America has striven."
